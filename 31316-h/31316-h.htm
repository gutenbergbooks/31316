<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>When the history of the Nineteenth Century&mdash;'the
Wonderful Century,' as it has, not inaptly, been
called&mdash;comes to be written, a foremost place must
be assigned to that great movement by which evolution
has become the dominant factor in scientific
progress, while its influence has been felt in every
sphere of human speculation and effort. At the
beginning of the Century, the few who ventured
to entertain evolutionary ideas were regarded by
their scientific contemporaries, as wild visionaries
or harmless 'cranks'&mdash;by the world at large, as
ignorant 'quacks' or 'designing atheists.' At the
end of the Century, evolution had not only become
the guiding principle of naturalists, but had profoundly
influenced every branch of physical science;
at the same time, suggesting new trains of thought
and permeating the language of philologists, historians,
sociologists, politicians&mdash;and even of theologians.</p>

<p>How has this revolution in thought&mdash;the greatest
which has occurred in modern times&mdash;been brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
about? What manner of men were they who were
the leaders in this great movement? What the
influences that led them to discard the old views and
adopt new ones? And, under what circumstances
were they able to produce the works which so
profoundly affected the opinions of the day? These
are the questions with which I propose to deal in the
following pages.</p>

<p>It has been my own rare good fortune to have
enjoyed the friendship of all the great leaders in this
important movement&mdash;of Huxley, Hooker, Scrope,
Wallace, Lyell and Darwin&mdash;and, with some of them,
I was long on terms of affectionate intimacy. From
their own lips I have learned of incidents, and
listened to anecdotes, bearing on the events of
a memorable past. Would that I could hope to
bring before my readers, in all their nobility, a vivid
picture of the characteristics of the men to whom
science and the world owe so much!</p>

<p>For it is not only by their intellectual greatness
that we are impressed. Every man of science is
proud, and justly proud, of the grandeur of character,
the unexampled generosity, the modesty and simplicity
which distinguished these pioneers in a great
cause. It is unfortunately true, that the votaries of
science&mdash;like the cultivators of art and literature&mdash;have
sometimes so far forgotten their high vocation,
as to have been more careful about the priority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of their personal claims than of the purity of their
own motives&mdash;they have sometimes, it must be sadly
admitted, allowed self-interest to obscure the interests
of science. But in the story we have to relate there
are no 'regrettable incidents' to be deplored; never
has there occurred any event that marred the harmony
in this band of fellow-workers, striving towards a
great ideal. So noble, indeed, was the great central
figure&mdash;Charles Darwin&mdash;that his senior Lyell and
all his juniors were bound to him by the strongest
ties of admiration, respect and affection; while he,
in his graceful modesty, thought more of them than
of himself, of the results of their labours rather than
of his own great achievement.</p>

<p>It is not, as sometimes suggested, the striking out
of new ideas which is of the greatest importance in
the history of science, but rather the accumulation
of observations and experiments, the reasonings
based upon these, and the writings in which facts
and reasonings are presented to the world&mdash;by which
a merely suggestive hypothesis becomes a vivifying
theory&mdash;that really count in making history.</p>

<p>Talking with Matthew Arnold in 1871, he laughingly
remarked to me 'I cannot understand why you
scientific people make such a fuss about Darwin.
Why it's all in Lucretius!' On my replying, 'Yes!
Lucretius guessed what Darwin proved,' he mischievously
rejoined 'Ah! that only shows how much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
greater Lucretius really was,&mdash;for he divined a truth,
which Darwin spent a life of labour in groping for.'</p>

<p>Mr Alfred Russel Wallace has so well and clearly
set forth the essential difference between the points
of view of the cultivators of literature and science
in this matter, that I cannot do better than to quote
his words. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I have long since come to see that no one deserves either
praise or blame for the <i>ideas</i> that come to him, but only for the
<i>actions</i> resulting therefrom. Ideas and beliefs are certainly not
voluntary acts. They come to us&mdash;we hardly know <i>how</i> or
<i>whence</i>, and once they have got possession of us we cannot reject
them or change them at will. It is for the common good that the
promulgation of ideas should be free&mdash;uninfluenced by either
praise or blame, reward or punishment.'</p>

<p>'But the <i>actions</i> which result from our ideas may properly be so
treated, because it is only by patient thought and work that new
ideas, if good and true, become adopted and utilized; while,
if untrue or if not adequately presented to the world, they are
rejected or forgotten<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></div>

<p><i>Ideas</i> of Evolution, both in the Organic and the
Inorganic world, existed but remained barren for
thousands of years. Yet by the labours of a band
of workers in last century, these ideas, which were
but the dreams of poets and the guesses of philosophers,
came to be the accepted creed of working
naturalists, while they have profoundly affected
thought and language in every branch of human
enterprise.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION</h3>


<p>In all ages, and in all parts of the world, we find
that primitive man has delighted in speculating on
the birth of the world in which he lives, on the origin
of the living things that surround him, and especially
on the beginnings of the race of beings to which he
himself belongs. In a recent very interesting essay<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
the author of <i>The Golden Bough</i> has collected, from
the records of tradition, history and travel, a valuable
mass of evidence concerning the legends which have
grown out of these speculations. Myths of this kind
would appear to fall into two categories, each of
which may not improbably be associated with the
different pursuits followed by the uncivilised races
of mankind.</p>

<p>Tillers of the soil, impressed as they must have
been by the great annual miracle of the outburst of
vegetable life as spring returns, naturally adopted
one of these lines of speculation. From the dead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
bare ground they witnessed the upspringing of all
the wondrous beauty of the plant-world, and, in their
ignorance of the chemistry of vegetable life, they
imagined that the herbs, shrubs and trees are all
alike built up out of the materials contained in the
soil from which they grow. The recognition of the
fact that animals feed on plants, or on one another,
led to the obvious conclusion that the <i>ultimate</i>
materials of animal, as well as of vegetable, structures
were to be sought for in the soil. And this view was
confirmed by the fact that, when life ceases in plants
or animals, all alike are reduced to 'dust' and again
become a part of the soil&mdash;returning 'earth to earth.'
In groping therefore for an explanation of the origin
of living things, what could be more natural than the
supposition that the first plants and animals&mdash;like
those now surrounding us&mdash;were made and fashioned
from the soil, dust or earth&mdash;all had been 'clay in
the hands of a potter.' The widely diffused notion
that man himself must have been moulded out of <i>red</i>
clay is probably accounted for by the colour of our
internal organs.</p>

<p>Thus originated a large class of legendary stories,
many of them of a very grotesque character. Even
in many mediaeval sculptures, in this country and on
the continent, the Deity is represented as moulding
with his hands the semblance of a human figure out
of a shapeless lump of clay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>But among the primitive hunters and herdsmen
a very different line of speculation appears to have
originated, for by their occupations they were continually
brought into contact with an entirely different
class of phenomena. They could not but notice that
the creatures which they hunted or tended, and slew,
presented marked resemblances to themselves&mdash;in
their structures, their functions, their diseases, their
dispositions, and their habits. When dogs and horses
became the servants and companions of men, and
when various beasts and birds came to be kept as
pets, the mental and even the moral processes
characterising the intelligence of these animals must
have been seen by their masters to be identical in
kind with those of their own minds. Do we not even
at the present day compare human characteristics
with those of animals, the courage of the lion, the
cunning of the fox, the fidelity of the dog, and the
parental affection of the bird? And the men, who
depended for their very existence on studying the
ways of various animals, could not have been less
impressed by these qualities than are we.</p>

<p>Mr Frazer has shown how, from such considerations,
the legends concerning the relations of certain
tribes of men with particular species of animals have
arisen, and thus the cults of 'sacred animals' and of
'totemism' have been gradually developed. From
comparisons of human courage, sagacity, swiftness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
strength or perseverance, with similar qualities displayed
by certain animals, it was an easy transition
to the idea that such characteristics were derived by
inheritance.</p>

<p>In the absence of any exact knowledge of anatomy
and physiology, the resemblances of animals to
themselves would quite outbulk the differences in
the eyes of primitive men, and the idea of close
relationship in blood does not appear to have been
regarded with distaste. In their origin and in their
destiny, no distinction was drawn between man and
what we now designate as the 'lower' animals.
Primitive man not only feels no repugnance to such
kinship:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful dog shall hear him company<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It should perhaps be remembered, too, that, in
the breeding of domestic animals, the great facts of
heredity and variation could not fail to have been
noticed, and must have given rise to reflection and
speculation. The selection of the best animals for
breeding purposes, and the consequent improvement
of their stock, may well have suggested the transmutation
of one kind of animal into a different kind,
just as the crossing of different kinds of animals
seems to have suggested the possible existence of
centaurs, griffins and other monstrous forms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>How early the principles of variation and heredity,
and even the possibility of improving breeds by
selection, must have been appreciated by early men
is illustrated by the old story of the way in which the
wily Jacob made an attempt&mdash;however futile were the
means he adopted&mdash;to cheat his employer Laban<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of observed tendencies to variation
among animals and plants, early man must have been
convinced of the existence of distinct kinds ('species')
in both the vegetable and animal worlds; he recognised
that plants of definite kinds yielded particular
fruits, and that different kinds of animals did not
breed promiscuously with one another, but that,
pairing each with its own kind, all gave rise to like
offspring, and thus arose the idea of distinct 'species'
of plants and animals.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that for a long
time 'the world' was believed to be limited to a few
districts surrounding the Eastern Mediterranean, and
the kinds or 'species' of animals and plants were
supposed to number a few scores or at most hundreds.
This being the case, the sudden stocking of 'the
world' with its complement of animals and plants
would be thought a comparatively simple operation,
and the violent destruction of the whole a scarcely
serious result. Even the possibility of the preservation
of pairs of all the different species, in a ship of
moderate dimensions, was one that was easily enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tained
and was not calculated to awaken either surprise
or incredulity.</p>

<p>But how different is the problem as it now presents
itself to us! In the year 1900 Professor S. H. Vines
of Oxford estimated that the number of 'species' of
plants that have been described could be little short
of 200,000, and that future studies, especially of the
lower microscopic forms, would probably bring that
number up to 300,000<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Last year, Mr A. E. Shipley
of Cambridge, basing his estimate on the earlier one
of Dr G&uuml;nther, came to the conclusion that the number
of described animals must also exceed 300,000<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. On
the lowest estimate then we must place the number
of known species of plants and animals, living on the
globe, as 600,000! And if we consider the numbers
of new forms of plants and animals that every year
are being described by naturalists&mdash;about 1500 plants
and 1200 animals&mdash;if we take into account the inaccessible
or as yet unvisited portions of the earth's
surface, the very imperfectly known depths of the sea,
and, in addition to these, the almost infinite varieties
of minute and microscopic forms, I think every competent
judge would consider <i>a million</i> as being
probably an estimate below, rather than above, the
number of 'species' now existing on the earth!</p>

<p>While some of these species are very widely
distributed over the earth's surface, or in the waters
of the oceans, seas, lakes and rivers, there are others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which are as strikingly limited in their range. Many
of the myriad forms of insect-life pass their whole
existence, and are dependent for food, on a particular
species of plant. Not a few animals and plants are
parasitical, and can only live in the interior or on the
outside of other plants and animals.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these considerations that in
attempting to decide between the two hypotheses of
the <i>origin</i> of species&mdash;the only ones ever suggested&mdash;namely
the fashioning of them out of dead matter, or
their descent with modification from pre-existing
forms, we are dealing with a problem of much greater
complexity than could possibly have been imagined
by the early speculators on the subject.</p>

<p>The two strongly contrasted hypotheses to which
we have referred are often spoken of as 'creation'
and 'evolution.' But this is an altogether illegitimate
use of these terms. By <i>whatever method</i> species of
plants or animals come into existence, they may be
rightly said to be 'created.' We speak of the
existing plants and animals as having been created,
although we well know them to have been 'evolved'
from seeds, eggs and other 'germs'&mdash;and indeed from
those excessively minute and simple structures known
as 'cells.' Lyell and Darwin, as we shall presently
see, though they were firmly convinced that species of
plants and animals were slowly developed and not
suddenly manufactured, wrote constantly and correctly
of the 'creation' of new forms of life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea of 'descent with modification,' derived
from the early speculations of hunters and herdsmen,
is really a much nobler and more beautiful conception
of 'creation' than that of the 'fashioning out of
clay,' which commended itself to the primitive agriculturalists.</p>

<p>Lyell writing to his friend John Herschel, who
like himself believed in the derivation of new species
from pre-existing ones by the action of secondary
causes, wrote in 1836:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When I first came to the notion, ... of a succession of
extinction of species, and creation of new ones, going on perpetually
now, and through an indefinite period of the past, and to
continue for ages to come, all in accommodation to the changes
which must continue in the inanimate and habitable earth, the
idea struck me as the grandest which I had ever conceived, so far
as regards the attributes of the Presiding Mind<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>And Darwin concludes his presentment of the
doctrine of evolution in the <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859
with the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several
powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few
forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on
according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning
endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and
are being, evolved<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Compare with these suggestions the ideas embodied
in the following lines&mdash;ideas of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
crudeness cannot be concealed by all the witchery of
Milton's immortal verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'The Earth obey'd, and straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Op'ning her fertile womb, teem'd at a birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limb'd and full grown. Out of the ground up rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from his lair, the wild beast, where he wons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the trees they rose, they walk'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cattle in the fields and meadows green:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those rare and solitary, these in flocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grassy clods now calv'd; now half appear'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tawny lion, pawing to get free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hinder parts, then springs, as broke from bonds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rampant shakes his brinded mane<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Can anyone doubt for a moment which is the
grander view of 'Creation'&mdash;that embodied in
Darwin's prose, or the one so strikingly pictured in
Milton's poetry?</p>

<p>We see then that the two ideas of the method of
creation, dimly perceived by early man, have at last
found clear and definite expression from these two
authors&mdash;Milton and Darwin. It is a singular coincidence
that these two great exponents of the rival
hypotheses were both students in the same University
of Cambridge and indeed resided in the same foundation&mdash;and
that not one of the largest of that
University&mdash;namely Christ's College.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION TO
THE INORGANIC WORLD</h3>


<p>We have seen in the preceding chapter that, with
respect to the origin of plants and animals&mdash;including
man himself&mdash;two very distinct lines of speculation
have arisen; these two lines of thought may be
expressed by the terms 'manufacture'&mdash;literally
making by hand, and 'development' or 'evolution,'&mdash;a
gradual unfolding from simpler to more complex
forms. Now with respect to the <i>inorganic</i> world two
parallel hypotheses of 'creation' have arisen, like
those relating to <i>organic</i> nature; but in the former
case the determining factor in the choice of ideas has
been, not the avocations of the primitive peoples, but
the nature of their surroundings.</p>

<p>The dwellers in the valleys of the Euphrates and
Tigris could not but be impressed by the great and
destructive floods to which those regions were subject;
and the inhabitants of the shores and islands of the
Aegean Sea, and of the Italian peninsula, were equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
conversant with the devastations wrought by volcanic
outbursts and earthquake shocks. As great districts
were seen to be depopulated by these catastrophies,
might not some even more violent cataclysm of the
same kind actually destroy all mankind, with the
animals and plants, in the comparatively small area
then known as 'the world'? The great flood, of
which all these nations appear to have retained traditions,
was regarded as only the last of such destructive
cataclysms; and, in this way, there originated
the myth of successive destructions of the face of the
earth, each followed by the creation of new stocks of
plants and animals. This is the doctrine now known
as 'Catastrophism,' which we find prevalent in the
earliest traditions and writings of India, Babylonia,
Syria and Greece.</p>

<p>But in ancient Egypt quite another class of
phenomena was conspicuously presented to the early
philosophers of the country. Instead of sudden floods
and terrible displays of volcanic and earthquake
violence, they witnessed the annual gentle rise and
overflowings of their grand river, with its beneficent
heritage of new soil; and they soon learned to
recognise that Egypt itself&mdash;so far as the delta was
concerned&mdash;was 'the gift of the Nile.'</p>

<p>From the contemplation of these phenomena, the
Egyptian sages were gradually led to entertain the
idea that all the features of the earth&mdash;as they knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
it&mdash;might have been similarly produced through the
slow and constant action of the causes now seen in
operation around them. This idea was incorporated
in a myth, which was suggested by the slow and
gradual transformation of an egg into a perfect,
growing organism. The birth of the world was
pictured as an act of incubation, and male and female
deities were invented to play the part of parents to
the infant world. By Pythagoras, who resided for
more than twenty years in Egypt, these ideas were
introduced to the Greek philosophers, and from that
time 'Catastrophism' found a rival in the new
doctrine which we shall see has been designated under
the names of 'Continuity,' 'Uniformitarianism' or
'Evolution.' How, from the first crude notions of
evolution, successive thinkers developed more just and
noble conceptions on the subject, has been admirably
shown by Professor Osborn in his <i>From the Greeks to
Darwin</i> and by Mr Clodd in his <i>Pioneers of Evolution</i>.</p>

<p>Poets, from Empedocles and Lucretius to Goethe
and Tennyson, have sought in their verses to illustrate
the beauty of evolutionary ideas; and philosophers,
from Aristotle and Strabo to Kant and Herbert
Spencer, have recognised the principle of evolution
as harmonising with, and growing out of, the highest
conceptions of science. Yet it was not till the Nineteenth
Century that any serious attempts were made
to establish the hypothesis of evolution as a definite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
theory, based on sound reasoning from careful observation.</p>

<p>It is true that there were men, in advance of their
age, who in some cases anticipated to a certain extent
this work of establishing the doctrine of evolution on
a firm foundation. Thus in Italy, the earliest home
of so many sciences, a Carmelite friar, Generelli,
reasoning on observations made by his compatriots
Fracastoro and Leonardo da Vinci in the Sixteenth
Century, Steno and Scilla in the Seventeenth, and
Lazzaro Moro and Marsilli in the Eighteenth Century,
laid the foundations of a rational system of geology in
a work published in 1749 which was characterised
alike by courage and eloquence. In France, the
illustrious Nicolas Desmarest, from his study of the
classical region of the Auvergne, was able to show, in
1777, how the river valleys of that district had been
carved out by the rivers that flow in them. Nor were
there wanting geologists with similar previsions in
Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>But none of these early exponents of geological
theory came so near to anticipating the work of the
Nineteenth Century as did the illustrious James
Hutton, whose 'Theory of the Earth,' a first sketch
of which was published in 1785, was a splendid exposition
of evolution as applied to the inorganic world.
Unfortunately, Hutton's theory was linked to the
extravagancies of what was known at that day as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
'Vulcanism' or 'Plutonism,' in contradistinction to
the 'Neptunism' of Werner. Hutton, while rejecting
the Wernerian notion of "the aqueous precipitation
of basalt," maintained the equally fanciful idea that
the consolidation of all strata&mdash;clays, sandstones,
conglomerates, limestones and even rock-salt&mdash;must
be ascribed to the action of heat, and that even the
formation of chalk-flints and the silicification of fossil
wood were due to the injection of molten silica!</p>

<p>What was still more unfortunate in Hutton's case
was that, in his enthusiasm, he used expressions which
led to his being charged with heresy and even with
being an enemy of religion. His writings were
further so obscure in style as often to lead to misconception
as to their true meaning, while his great work&mdash;so
far as the fragment which was published goes&mdash;contained
few records of original observations on
which his theory was based.</p>

<p>Dr Fitton has pointed out very striking coincidences
between the writings of Generelli and those of
Hutton, and has suggested that the latter may have
derived his views from the eloquent Italian friar<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
But for this suggestion, I think that there is no real
foundation. Darwin and Wallace, as we shall see
later, were quite unconscious of their having been
forestalled in the theory of Natural Selection by
Dr Wells and Patrick Matthew; and Hutton, like
his successor Lyell, in all probability arrived, quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
independently, and by different lines of reasoning,
at conclusions identical with those of Generelli and
Desmarest.</p>

<p>Although, as we shall see, Hutton failed to greatly
influence the scientific thought of his day, yet all will
now agree with Lyell that 'Hutton laboured to give
fixed principles to geology, as Newton had succeeded
in doing to astronomy<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>'; and with Zittel that
'<i>Hutton's Theory of the Earth</i> is one of the masterpieces
in the history of geology<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.'</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE TRIUMPH OF CATASTROPHISM OVER
EVOLUTION</h3>


<p>There is no fact in the history of science which is
more certain than that those great pioneers of Evolution
in the Inorganic world&mdash;Generelli, Desmarest
and Hutton&mdash;utterly failed to recommend their
doctrines to general acceptance; and that, at the
beginning of last century, everything in the nature of
evolutionary ideas was almost universally discredited&mdash;alike
by men of science and the world at large.</p>

<p>The causes of the neglect and opprobrium which
befel all evolutionary teachings are not difficult to
discover. The old Greek philosophers saw no more
reason to doubt the possibility of creation by evolution,
than by direct mechanical means. But, on the
revival of learning in Europe, evolution was at once
confronted by the cosmogonies of Jewish and Arabian
writers, which were incorporated in sacred books; and
not only were the ideas of the sudden making and
destruction of the world and all things in it regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
as revealed truth, but the periods of time necessary for
evolution could not be admitted by those who believed
the beginning of the world to have been recent, and
its end to be imminent. Thus 'Catastrophic' ideas
came to be regarded as <i>orthodox</i>, and evolutionary
ones as utterly irreligious and damnable.</p>

<p>There are few more curious facts in the history of
science than the contrast between the reception of
the teaching of the Saxon professor Werner, and
those of Hutton, the Scotch philosopher, his great
rival. While the enthusiastic disciples of the former
carried their master's ideas everywhere, acting with
missionary zeal and fervour, and teaching his doctrines
almost as though they were a divine revelation, the
latter, surrounded by a few devoted friends, saw his
teachings everywhere received with persistent misrepresentation,
theological vituperation or contemptuous
neglect. Even in Edinburgh itself, one of
Werner's pupils dominated the teaching of the
University for half a century, and established a society
for the propagation of the views which Hutton so
strongly opposed.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that Hutton wrote at a
time when 'heresy-hunting' in this country had been
excited to such a dangerous extent, through the
excesses of the French Revolution, that his contemporary,
Priestley, had been hounded from his home
and country for proclaiming views which at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
time were regarded as unscriptural, it becomes less
difficult to understand the prejudice that was excited
against the gentle and modest philosopher of
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>We have employed the term 'Catastrophism' to
indicate the views which were prevalent at the
beginning of last century concerning the origin of the
rock-masses of the globe and their fossil contents.
These views were that at a number of successive
epochs&mdash;of which the age of Noah was the latest&mdash;great
revolutions had taken place on the earth's
surface; that during each of these cataclysms all
living things were destroyed; and that, after an
interval, the world was restocked with fresh assemblages
of plants and animals, to be destroyed in turn
and entombed in the strata at the next revolution.</p>

<p>Whewell, in 1830, contrasted this teaching with
that of Hutton and Lyell in the following passage:&mdash;'These
two opinions will probably for some time
divide the geological world into two sects, which may
perhaps be designated the "Uniformitarians" and
the "Catastrophists." The latter has undoubtedly
been of late the prevalent doctrine.' It is interesting
to note, as showing the confidence felt in their tenets
by the 'Catastrophists' of that day, that Whewell
adds 'We conceive that Mr Lyell will find it a harder
task than he imagines to overturn the established
belief<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Some authors have suggested that the doctrine
taught by Generelli, Desmarest and Hutton, and later
by Scrope and Lyell, for which Whewell proposed the
somewhat cumbrous term 'Uniformitarianism,' but
which was perhaps better designated by Grove in
1866 as 'Continuity<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>,' was distinct from, and subsidiary
to, Evolution&mdash;and this view could claim for a
time the support of a very great authority.</p>

<p>In 1869, Huxley delivered an address to the
Geological Society, in which he postulated the existence
of 'three more or less contradictory systems of
geological thought,' under the names of 'Catastrophism,'
'Uniformitarianism' and 'Evolution.' In
this essay, distinguished by all his wonderful lucidity
and forceful logic, Huxley sought to establish the
position that evolution is a doctrine, distinct from and
<i>in advance of</i> that of uniformitarianism, and that
Hutton and Playfair&mdash;'and to a less extent Lyell'&mdash;had
acted unwisely in deprecating the extension of
Geology into enquiries concerning 'the beginning of
things<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.'</p>

<p>But there is no doubt that Huxley at a later
period was led to qualify, and indeed to largely modify,
the views maintained in that address. In a footnote
to an essay written in April 1887, he asserts
'What I mean by "evolutionism" is consistent and
thoroughgoing uniformitarianism'; and in the same
year he wrote in his <i>Reception of the Origin of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Species</i><a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>: 'Consistent uniformitarianism postulates
evolution, as much in the organic as in the inorganic
world<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.'</p>

<p>It is not difficult to trace the causes of this change
in the attitude of mind with which Huxley regarded
the doctrine of 'uniformitarianism.' He assures us
'I owe more than I can tell to the careful study of
the <i>Principles of Geology</i><a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,' and again 'Lyell was for
others as for me the chief agent in smoothing the road
for Darwin<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.' From the perusal of the letters of
Lyell, published in 1881, Huxley learned that the
author of the <i>Principles of Geology</i> had, at a very
early date, been convinced that evolution was true of
the organic as well as of the inorganic world&mdash;though
he had been unable to accept Lamarckism, or any
other hypothesis on the subject that had, up to that
time, been suggested. There can be little doubt,
however, that a chief influence in bringing about the
change in Huxley's views was his intercourse with
Darwin&mdash;who was, from first to last, an uncompromising
'uniformitarian.'</p>

<p>We are fully justified, then, in regarding the
teaching of Hutton and Lyell (to which Whewell gave
the name of 'uniformitarianism') as being identical
with evolution. The cockpit in which the great battle
between catastrophism and evolution was fought out,
as we shall see in the sequel, was the Geological
Society of London, where doughty champions of each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the rival doctrines met in frequent combat and
long maintained the struggle for supremacy.</p>

<p>Fitton has very truly said that 'the views proposed
by Hutton failed to produce general conviction at
the time; and several years elapsed before any one
showed himself publicly concerned about them, either
as an enemy or a friend<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.' Sad is it to relate that,
when notice was at last taken of the memoir on the
'Theory of the Earth,' it was by bitter opponents&mdash;such
'Philistines' (as Huxley calls them) as
Kirwan, De Luc and Williams, who declared the
author to be an enemy of religion. Not only did
Hutton, unlike the writers of other theories of the
earth, omit any statement that his views were based
on the Scriptures, but, carried away by the beauty of
the system of continuity which he advocated, he wrote
enthusiastically 'the result of this physical enquiry is
that we find no vestige of a beginning&mdash;no prospect
of an end<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.' This was unjustly asserted to be
equivalent to a declaration that the world had neither
beginning nor end; and thus it came about that
Wernerism, Neptunism and Catastrophism were long
regarded as synonymous with Orthodoxy, while
Plutonism and 'Uniformitarianism' were looked
upon with aversion and horror as subversive of
religion and morality.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the foundation of the
Wernerian Society of Edinburgh (in 1807) was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
establishment in London of the Geological Society.
Originating in a dining club of collectors of minerals,
the society consisted at first almost exclusively of
mineralogists and chemists, including Davy, Wollaston,
Sir James Hall, and later, Faraday and Turner. The
bitter but barren conflict between the Neptunists and
the Plutonists was then at its height, and it was, from
the first, agreed in the infant society to confine its
work almost entirely to the collection of facts,
eschewing theory. During the first decade of its
existence, it is true, the chief papers published by
the society were on mineralogical questions; but
gradually geology began to assert itself. The actual
founder and first president of the society, Greenough,
had been a pupil of Werner, and used all his great
influence to discourage the dissemination of any but
Wernerian doctrines&mdash;foreign geologists, like Dr
Berger, being subsidised to apply the Wernerian
classification and principles to the study of British
rocks. Thus, in early days, the Geological Society
became almost as completely devoted to the teaching
of Wernerian doctrines as was the contemporary
society in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Dr Buckland used to say that when he joined the
Geological Society in 1813, 'it had a very <i>landed</i>
manner, and only admitted the professors of geology
in Oxford and Cambridge on sufferance.'</p>

<p>But, gradually, changes began to be felt in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
aristocratic body of exclusive amateurs and wealthy
collectors of minerals. William Smith, 'the Father
of English Geology'&mdash;though he published little and
never joined the society&mdash;exercised a most important
influence on its work. By his maps, and museum of
specimens, as well as by his communications, so freely
made known, concerning his method of 'identifying
strata by their organic remains,' many of the old geologists,
who were not aware at the time of the source
of their inspiration, were led to adopt entirely new
methods of studying the rocks. In this way, the
accurate mineralogical and geognostical methods of
Werner came to be supplemented by the fruitful
labours of the stratigraphical palaeontologist. The new
school of geologists included men like William Phillips,
Conybeare, Sedgwick, Buckland, De la Beche, Fitton,
Mantell, Webster, Lonsdale, Murchison, John Phillips
and others, who laid the foundations of British stratigraphical
geology.</p>

<p>But these great geological pioneers, almost without
exception, maintained the Wernerian doctrines
and were firm adherents of Catastrophism. The three
great leaders&mdash;the enthusiastic Buckland, the eloquent
Sedgwick, and the indefatigable Conybeare&mdash;were
clergymen, as were also Whewell and Henslow, and
they were all honestly, if mistakenly, convinced that
the Huttonian teaching was opposed to the Scriptures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and inimical to religion and morality. Buckland at
Oxford, and Sedgwick at Cambridge, made geology
popular by combining it with equestrian exercise;
and Whewell tells us how the eccentric Buckland used
to ride forth from the University, with a long cavalcade
of mounted students, holding forth with sarcasm
and ridicule concerning 'the inadequacy of existing
causes<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.'</p>

<p>And Sedgwick at Cambridge was no less firmly
opposed to evolutionary doctrine, eloquently declaiming
at all times against the unscriptural tenets of the
Huttonians.</p>

<p>I cannot better illustrate the complete neglect at
that time by leading geologists in this country of the
Huttonian teaching than by pointing to the Report
drawn up in 1833, by Conybeare, for the British
Association, on 'The Progress, Actual State and
Ulterior Prospects of Geological Science<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.' This
valuable memoir of 47 pages opens with a sketch of
the history of the science, in which the chief Italian,
French and German investigators are referred to, but
the name of Hutton is not even mentioned!</p>

<p>And if positive evidence is required of the contempt
which the early geologists felt for Hutton and
his teachings, it will be found in the same author's
introduction to that classical work, the <i>Outlines of
Geology</i> (1822), in which he says of Hutton, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
praising his views on granite veins and "trap
rocks":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The wildness of many of his theoretical views, however, went
far to counterbalance the utility of the additional facts which he
collected from observation. He who could perceive in geology
nothing but the <i>ordinary</i> operation of actual causes, carried
on in the same manner through infinite ages, without the
trace of a beginning or the prospect of an end, must have
surveyed them through the medium of a preconceived hypothesis
alone<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>John Playfair, the brilliant author of the <i>Illustrations
of the Huttonian Theory</i>, died in 1819; under
happier conditions his able work might have done for
Inorganic Evolution what his great master failed to
accomplish; but the dead weight of prejudice and the
dread of anything that seemed to savour of infidelity
was, at the time of the great European struggle
against revolutionary France, too great to be removed
even by his lucid statements and eloquent advocacy.
James Hall and Leonard Horner, two faithful disciples
of Hutton, who had joined the infant Geological
Society, forsook it early, the former leaving it on
account of the quarrel with the Royal Society, the
latter retaining his fellowship and interest, but going
to live at Edinburgh. Greenough, 'The Objector
General,' as he was called, was left, fanatically
opposing any attempt to stem the current that had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
set so strongly in favour of Wernerism and Neptunism,
and the Catastrophic doctrines which all thought to
be necessary conclusions from them. The great
heroic workers of that day&mdash;while they were laying
well and truly the foundations of historical geology&mdash;were,
one and all, indifferent to, or violently opposed
to, the Huttonian teaching. Neither Fitton nor John
Phillips, who at a later date showed sympathy with
evolutionary doctrines, were the men to fight the
battle of an unpopular cause.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made by both Playfair and
Fitton to explain how it was that Hutton's teaching
failed to arrest the attention it deserved. The former
justly asserted that the world was tired of the performances
issued under the title of 'theories of the
earth'; and that the condensed nature of Hutton's
writings, with their 'embarrassment of reasoning and
obscurity of style<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>' are largely responsible for the
neglect into which they fell.</p>

<p>Fitton, in 1839, wrote in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
'The original work of Hutton (in two volumes) is in
fact so scarce that no very great number of our
readers can have seen it. No copy exists at present
in the libraries of the Royal Society, the Linnean,
or even the Geological Society of London<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>!' He
also points out that Hutton's work, and even the
more lucid <i>Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
were almost unknown on the continent, owing to the
isolation of Great Britain during the war; and he
even suggests that the popularity of Playfair in this
country may have not improbably led to the neglect
of the original work of Hutton<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>On the continent, indeed, the authority of Cuvier
was supreme, and in his <i>Essay on the Theory of the
Earth</i>, prefixed to his <i>Opus magnum</i>&mdash;the <i>Ossemens
Fossiles</i>&mdash;the great naturalist threw the whole weight
of his influence into the scale of Catastrophism. He
maintained that a series of tremendous cataclysms
had affected the globe&mdash;the last being the Noachian
deluge&mdash;and that the floods of water that overspread
the earth, during each of these events, had buried
the various groups of animals, now extinct, that had
been successively created.</p>

<p>If anything had been wanted in England to support
and confirm the views that were then supposed
to be the only ones in harmony with the Scriptures,
it was found in the great authority of Cuvier. As
Zittel justly says, Cuvier's theory of 'World-Catastrophies'&mdash;'which
afforded a certain scientific basis
for the Mosaic account of the "Flood," was received with
special cordiality in England, for there, more than in
any other country, theological doctrines had always
affected geological conceptions<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.' Britain, which had
produced the great philosopher, Hutton, had now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
become the centre of the bitterest opposition to his
teachings!</p>

<p>But 'the darkest hour of night is that which
precedes the dawn,' and while the forces of reaction
in this country appeared to be triumphant over
Hutton's teaching, there was in preparation, to use the
words of Darwin, a 'grand work' ... 'which the future
historian will recognise as having produced a revolution
in natural science.'</p>

<h3>THE REVOLT OF SCROPE AND LYELL AGAINST
CATASTROPHISM</h3>


<p>The year 1797, in which the illustrious Hutton
died, leaving behind him the noble fragments of
a monumental work, was signalised by the birth
of two men, who were destined to bring about the
overthrow of Catastrophism, and to establish, upon
the firm foundation of reasoned observation, the
despised doctrine of Uniformitarianism or Evolution&mdash;as
outlined by Generelli, Desmarest and Hutton.
These two men were George Poulett Thomson (who
afterwards took the name of Scrope) and Charles
Lyell. Both of them were, from their youth upwards,
brought under the strongest influences of
the prevalent anti-evolutionary teachings; but both
emancipated themselves from the effects of these
teachings, being led gradually by their geological
travels and observations, not only to reject their
early faith, but to become the champions of Evolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a singular parallel between the early
careers of these two men. Both were the sons of
parents of ample means, and were thus freed from
the distractions of a business or profession, while
throughout life they alike remained exempt from
family cares. Each of them received the ordinary
education of the English upper classes&mdash;Scrope at
Harrow, and Lyell at Salisbury, in a school conducted
by a Winchester master on public-school lines. In
due course, the two young men proceeded to the
University&mdash;Scrope to Cambridge, to come under the
influence of the sagacious and eloquent Sedgwick,
and Lyell to Oxford, to catch inspiration from the
enthusiastic but eccentric Buckland. On the opening
up of the continent, by the termination of the French
wars, each of the young men accompanied his family
in a carriage-tour (as was the fashion of the time)
through France, Switzerland and Italy; and both
utilised the opportunities thus afforded them, to
make long walking excursions for geological study.
They both returned again and again to the continent
for the purpose of geological research, and in the year
1825, at the age of 28, found themselves associated
as joint-secretaries of the Geological Society. By
this time they had arrived at similar convictions
concerning the causes of geological phenomena&mdash;convictions
which were in direct opposition to the
views of their early teachers, and equally obnoxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to all the leaders of geological thought in the infant
society which they had joined.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/ill_044.jpg" width="402" height="617" alt="G Poulett Scrope" title="" />
</div>

<p>It is interesting to note that each of these two
young geologists arrived independently, <i>as the result
of their own studies and observations</i>, at their
conclusions concerning the futility of the prevailing
catastrophic doctrines. This I am able to affirm, not
only from their published and unpublished letters,
but from frequent conversations I had with them in
their later years.</p>

<p>Scrope, who was slightly the elder of the two
friends, spent a considerable time in that wonderful
district of France&mdash;the Auvergne&mdash;in the year 1821,
and though he had not seen the map and later
memoirs of Desmarest, he pourtrayed the structure
of the country in a series of very striking panoramic
views, and was led, independently of the great French
observer, to the same conclusions as his concerning
the volcanic origin of the basalts and the formation
of the valleys by river-action. Scrope was at that
time equally ignorant of the views propounded both
by Generelli and by Hutton.</p>

<p>By April 6th, 1822, Scrope had completed his
masterly work <i>The Geology and Extinct Volcanoes
of Central France</i>, and had despatched it to England.
It would be idle to speculate now as to what might
have been the effect of that work&mdash;so full of the
results of accurate observation, and so suggestive in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
its reasoning&mdash;had it been published at that time.
It is quite possible that much of the credit now
justly assigned to Lyell, would have belonged to his
friend. Unfortunately, however, Scrope, instead of
seeing his work through the press, determined first
to make another tour in Italy. He arrived at Naples
just in time to witness and describe the grandest
eruption of Vesuvius in modern times, that of October
1822. What he witnessed then&mdash;the blowing away
of the whole upper part of the mountain and the
formation of a vast crater 1000 feet deep&mdash;made a
profound impression on Scrope's mind. His interest
thus strongly aroused concerning igneous phenomena,
Scrope continued his travels and observations on the
volcanic rocks of the peninsula of Italy and its
islands, and was thus led to a number of important
conclusions in theoretical geology, which he embodied
in a work, published in 1825, entitled <i>Considerations
on Volcanos: the probable causes of their phenomena,
the laws which determine their march, the disposition
of their products, and their connexion with the present
state and past history of the globe; leading to the
establishment of a New Theory of the Earth</i>.</p>

<p>It is only right to point out that, in calling this
book a <i>new</i> 'Theory of the Earth,' Scrope had no
intention of comparing it with Hutton's great
work, with which he was at that time altogether
unacquainted. Nevertheless, his conclusions, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
independently arrived at, were almost identical with
those of the great Scotch philosopher. But Scrope
made the same mistake as Hutton had done before
him. He allowed his theoretical conclusions to
precede, instead of following upon an account of
the observations on which they were based. Scrope's
book is certainly one of the most original and
suggestive contributions ever made to geological
science; but the very speculative character of a
large portion of the work led to the neglect of the
really valuable hypotheses and acute observations
which it contained. In the preface, however, the
author gives a most striking and complete summary
of the doctrine of Evolution as opposed to Catastrophism,
in the inorganic world, as will be shown
by the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Geology has for its business a knowledge of the processes
which are in continual or occasional operation within the limits
of our planet, and the application of these laws to explain the
appearances discovered by our Geognostical researches, so as from
these materials to deduce conclusions as to the past history of
the globe.</p>

<p>The surface of the globe exposes to the eye of the Geognost
abundant evidence of a variety of changes which appear to have
succeeded one another during an incalculable lapse of time.</p>

<p>These changes are chiefly,</p>

<p>I. Variations of level between different constituent parts of
the solid surface of the globe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>II. The destruction of former rocks, and their reproduction
under another form.</p>

<p>III. The production of rocks <i>de novo</i> upon the earth's surface.</p>

<p>Geologists have usually had recourse for the explanation of
these changes to the supposition of sundry violent and extraordinary
catastrophes, cataclysms, or general revolutions having
occurred in the physical state of the earth's surface.</p>

<p>As the idea imparted by the term Cataclysm, Catastrophe,
or Revolution, is extremely vague, and may comprehend any thing
you choose to imagine, it answers for the time very well as an
explanation; that is, it stops further inquiry. But it has also the
disadvantage of effectually stopping the advance of science, by
involving it in obscurity and confusion.</p>

<p>If, however, in lieu of forming guesses as to what may have
been the possible causes and nature of these changes, we pursue
that, which I conceive the only legitimate path of geological
inquiry, and begin by examining the laws of nature which are
actually in force, we cannot but perceive that numerous physical
phenomena are going on at this moment on the surface of the
globe, by which various changes are produced in its constitution
and external characters; changes extremely analogous to those
of earlier date, whose nature is the main object of geological
inquiry.</p>

<p>These processes are principally,</p>

<p>I. The Atmospheric phenomena.</p>

<p>II. The laws of the circulation and residence of Water on
the exterior of the globe.</p>

<p>III. The action of Volcanos and Earthquakes.</p>

<p>The changes effected before our eyes, by the operation of these
causes, in the constitution of the crust of the earth are chiefly&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The Destruction of Rocks.</p>

<p>II. The Reproduction of others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Changes of Level.</p>

<p>IV. The Production of New Rocks from the interior of the
globe upon its surface.</p>

<p>Changes which in their general characters bear so strong an
analogy to those which are suspected to have occurred in the
earlier ages of the world's history, that, until the processes which
give rise to them have been maturely studied under every shape,
and then applied with strict impartiality to explain the appearances
in question; and until, after a long investigation, and with the
most liberal allowances for all possible variations, and an unlimited
series of ages, they have been found wholly inadequate to the
purpose, it would be the height of absurdity to have recourse
to any gratuitous and unexampled hypothesis for the solution
of these analogous facts<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p></div>

<p>It was not till 1826, four years after the completion
of the work, that Scrope managed to publish his book
on the Auvergne, and to tear himself away from
the speculative questions by which he had become
obsessed. No one could be more candid than he
was in acknowledging the causes of his failure to
impress his views upon his contemporaries. Writing
in 1858, he said of his <i>Considerations on Volcanos</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In that work unfortunately were included some speculations
on theoretic cosmogony, which the public mind was not at that
time prepared to entertain. Nor was this my first attempt at
authorship, sufficiently well composed, arranged or even printed,
to secure a fair appreciation for the really sound and, I believe,
original views on many points of geological interest which it
contained. I ought, no doubt, to have begun with a description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of the striking facts which I was prepared to produce from the
volcanic regions of Central France and Italy, in order to pave the
way for a favourable reception, or even a fair hearing, of the
theoretical views I had been led from these observations to
form<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>He adds that 'this obvious error was pointed out
in a very friendly manner' in a notice of the memoir
on <i>The Geology of Central France</i>, which was
contributed by Lyell to the <i>Quarterly Review</i> in
1827<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>Scrope's geological career however&mdash;though one
of so much promise&mdash;was brought to a somewhat
abrupt termination. In 1821 he had married the
last representative and heiress of the Scropes, the
old Earls of Wiltshire, and soon afterwards he settled
down at the family seat of Castle Combe, eventually
devoting his attention almost exclusively to social
and political questions. From 1833 to 1868, when
he retired from Parliament, he was member for
Stroud; and though he seldom took part in the
debates, he became famous as a writer of political
tracts, thus acquiring the sobriquet of 'Pamphlet
Scrope.' He himself used to relate an amusing
incident at his own expense. His great friend Lord
Palmerston, on being greeted with the question,
'Have you read my last pamphlet?' replied mischievously,
'Well Scrope, I hope I have!'</p>

<p>It is sad to relate that, owing to a carriage accident,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Scrope's wife became a confirmed invalid and he had
no child to succeed to the estate. Though cut off
by other duties from the geological world, Scrope
maintained his correspondence with his old friend
Lyell, and, as we shall see in the sequel, was able to
render him splendid service by the luminous though
discriminating reviews of the <i>Principles of Geology</i>
in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Throughout his life,
however, Scrope preserved a love of geology, and
occasionally contributed to the literature of the
science; and in his closing years, when unable to
travel himself, he gave to others the means of carrying
on the researches in which he had from the first
been so deeply interested.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Fortunately for science, Lyell's devotion to
geological study was not, like Scrope's, interrupted
by the claims made upon him by social and political
questions. Feeling though he did, with his friend,
the deepest sympathy in all liberal movements, and
being especially interested in the reform of educational
methods, his geological work always had the
first claim on his time and attention, and nothing was
allowed to interfere with his scientific labours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/ill_052.jpg" width="401" height="615" alt="Cha Lyell" title="" />
</div>

<p>Charles Lyell was the eldest son of a Scottish
laird, whose forbears, after making a fortune in India,
had purchased the estate of Kinnordy in Strathmore,
on the borders of the Highlands. Lyell's father was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
a man of culture, a good classical scholar, a translator
and commentator on Dante, and a cryptogamic
botanist of some reputation.</p>

<p>Lyell's mother, an Englishwoman from Yorkshire,
was a person of great force of character; this
she showed when, on coming to Kinnordy, she found
drunkenness so prevalent among the lairds of this
part of Scotland, as to cause a fear on her part, that
her husband might be drawn into the dangerous
society: she therefore induced him, when their son
Charles was only three months old, to abandon their
Scottish home, and settle in the New Forest of
Hampshire. Thus it came about that the future
geologist, though born in Scotland, became, by
education, habits and association, English.</p>

<p>Charles Lyell's attention was first drawn to
geology by seeing the quartz-crystals and chalcedony
exposed in the broken chalk-flints, which he, as a boy
of ten, used to roll down, in company with his school-fellows,
from the walls of Old Sarum. Like Charles
Darwin, too, he became an ardent and enthusiastic
collector of insects, and grew to be a tall and active
young fellow, a keen sportsman, with only one drawback&mdash;a
weakness of the eyes which troubled him
through all his after life.</p>

<p>It was when at the age of seventeen he went to
Oxford and came under the influence of Dr Buckland
that Lyell first became deeply engrossed in geology.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Lyell used to tell many amusing stories of the
oddities of his old teacher and friend Buckland. In
his lectures, both in the University and on public
platforms, Buckland would keep his audience in roars
of laughter, as he imitated what he thought to be
the movements of the iguanodon or megatherium,
or, seizing the ends of his long clerical coat-tails,
would leap about to show how the pterodactyle flew.
Lyell became greatly attached to Buckland, who used
to take him privately on geological expeditions. On
one of these occasions, they were dining at an inn,
where a gentleman at another table became greatly
scandalised by Buckland's conversation and manners.
The professor, seeing this, became more outrageous
than ever, and on parting with Lyell for the night
took the candle and placed it between his teeth, so
as to illuminate the mouth-cavity exclaiming, 'There
Lyell, practise this long enough and you will be able
to do it as well as I do.' When Buckland had retired,
the stranger revealed himself to Lyell as an old friend
of his father's, adding 'I hope you will never be seen
in the company of that buffoon again.' 'Oh! Sir,'
said the startled undergraduate, 'that is my professor
at Oxford!' But Buckland did not always originate
the fun, for Lyell told me that, when the professor
visited Kinnordy in his company, he led him a long
tramp under promise of showing him 'diluvium
intersected by whin dykes,' and, in the end, pointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to fields in a boulder-clay country separated by gorse
('whin') hedges ('dykes').</p>

<p>Buckland, as shown by his <i>Vindiciae Geologicae</i>
(1820) and his <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i> (1836), was the
most uncompromising of the advocates for making all
geological teaching subordinate to the literal interpretation
of the early chapters of Genesis; and in
his <i>Reliquiae Diluvianae</i> (1823) he stoutly maintained
the view that all the superficial deposits of the globe
were the result of the Noachian deluge! He was
indeed the great leader of the Catastrophists, and it
is not surprising to find Lyell, while still under his
influence, scoffing at 'the Huttonians<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.'</p>

<p>That Buckland greatly influenced Lyell in his
youth, especially by inoculating him with his splendid
enthusiasm for geology, there can be no doubt; and
Lyell, far as he departed in after life from the views
of his teacher, never forgot his indebtedness to the
Oxford professor. Even in 1832, in publishing the
second edition of the first volume of his <i>Principles</i>, he
dedicated it to Buckland, as one 'who first instructed
me in the elements of geology, and by whose energy
and talents the cultivation of science in the country
has been so eminently promoted<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.'</p>

<p>On leaving Oxford in 1819, at the age of twenty-two,
Lyell joined the Geological Society. What were
the dominant opinions at that time on geological
theory among the distinguished men, who were there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
laying the foundations of stratigraphical geology, we
have already seen. Lyell, in his frequent visits to the
continent, became a friend of the illustrious Cuvier,
whose strong bias for Catastrophism was so forcibly
shown in his writings and conversation.</p>

<p>What then, we may ask, were the causes which led
Lyell to abandon the views in which he had been
instructed, and to become the great champion of
Evolutionism?</p>

<p>It has often been assumed that Lyell was led by
the study of Hutton's works to adopt the Uniformitarian'
doctrines. But there is ample evidence that
such was not the case. As late as the year 1839,
Lyell wrote of Hutton, 'Though I tried, I doubt
whether I fairly read half his writings, and skimmed
the rest<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>'; and he emphatically assured Scrope 'Von
Hoff has assisted me most<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.'</p>

<p>The fact is certain that Lyell, quite independently,
arrived at the same conclusions as Hutton, <i>but by
totally different lines of reasoning</i>.</p>

<p>As early as 1817, when Lyell was only twenty
years of age, he visited the Norfolk coast and was
greatly impressed by the evidence of the waste of the
cliffs about Cromer, Aldborough, and Dunwich; and
three years later we find him studying the opposite
kind of action of the sea in the formation of new
land at Dungeness and Romney Marsh. All through
his life there may be seen the results of these early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
studies in a tendency which he showed to <i>overrate
marine action</i>; the chief defect in his early views
consisting in not fully realising the importance
of that subaerial denudation&mdash;of which Hutton was
so great an exponent. But it was in his native
county of Forfarshire that Lyell found the most
complete antidote to the Catastrophic teachings.
Buckland had taught him that the 'till' of the
country had been thrown down, just 4170 years
before, by the Noachian deluge: while Cuvier had
asserted that the study of freshwater limestones
proved them to differ from any recent deposit by
their crystalline character, the absence of shells and
the presence of plant-remains, as well as by the
occasional occurrence in them of bands of flint. As
the result of this, Cuvier and Brongniart had declared
that <i>the freshwater of the ancient world possessed
properties which are not observed in that of modern
lakes</i><a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Lyell visited Kinnordy from time to time
between 1817 and 1824, and found on his father's
estate and other localities in Strathmore a number
of small lakes, lying in hollows of the boulder clay.
These were being drained and their deposits quarried
for the purpose of 'marling' the land; the excavations
thus made showed that, under peat containing
a boat hollowed out of the trunk of a tree, there were
calcareous deposits, sometimes 16 to 20 feet in thickness,
which passed into a rock, solid and crystalline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
in character as the materials of the older geological
formations and containing the stems and fruits of the
freshwater plant <i>Chara</i> (Stone wort).</p>

<p>With the help of Robert Brown the botanist, and
of analyses made by Daubeny, with the advice of his
life-long friend, Faraday, Lyell was able to demonstrate
that from the waters of the Forfarshire lakes,
containing the most minute proportions of calcareous
salts, a limestone, identical in all respects with those
of the older rocks of the globe, had been deposited,
with excessive slowness, by the action of plant-life<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
He was thus enabled to supply a complete refutation
of the views put forward by Buckland and Cuvier.</p>

<p>Thus while Hutton had been led to his conclusion
concerning evolution in the inorganic world, by
studying the waste going on in the weathered crags
and the flooded rivers of his native land, Lyell's
conversion to the same views was mainly brought
about by the study of changes due to the action of
the sea along the English coasts, and by studying the
evidence of constant, though slow, deposition of limestone-rocks,
by the seemingly most insignificant of
agencies.</p>

<p>Lyell however did not by any means neglect the
study of the action of rain and rivers. During his
visits to Forfarshire, he had his initials and the date
cut by a mason on many portions of the rocky river-beds
about his home. Fifty years afterwards (in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
1874) I visited with him the several localities, to
ascertain what amount of waste had resulted from
the constant flow of water over these hard rocks. It
was in most cases singularly small, the inscriptions
being still visible, though deprived of their sharpness;
even the sandy detritus carried along by the streams,
being buoyed up by the water, had not been able in
half a century to wear away a thickness of half-an-inch
of the hard rock. The most singular result
we noticed was, that the leaden small shot fired by
sportsmen, in the Highland tracts, whence these
streams flowed, had collected in great numbers in
hollows formed by the young geologist's inscriptions.</p>

<p>By his father's request, Lyell after leaving Oxford
studied for the bar, but there is no doubt that his
main interest was in geological study. He had made
the acquaintance of Dr Mantell, and carried on
a number of researches in the south of England
either alone or with that geologist<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. Four years
after joining the Geological Society, in which he was
a constant worker, he became one of the secretaries.
This was in 1823 when he was only 26 years of age.
His frequent visits to Paris and to various parts of
the continent enabled him to exchange ideas with
many foreign naturalists, and it is clear from his
correspondence that at this early period he had
abandoned the Catastrophic doctrines of his teachers
and friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now consider the outside influences which
were at work on Lyell's mind in these early days. In
the year 1818, the eminent palaeontologist Blumenbach
induced the University of G&ouml;ttingen to offer a prize
for an essay on '<i>The investigation of the changes
that have taken place in the earth's surface conformation
since historic times, and the applications
which can be made of such knowledge in investigating
earth revolutions beyond the domain of history.</i>' A
young German, Von Hoff, won the prize by a most
able book, displaying great erudition, entitled <i>The
History of those Natural Changes in the Earth's
Surface, which are proved by Tradition</i>. The
first volume of this work appeared in 1822, and
treated of the results produced on the land by the
action of the sea; the second volume, published in
1824, dealt with the effects of volcanoes and earthquakes.
Von Hoff's learned work was confined to
the collection of data from classical and other early
authors bearing on these subjects, and to reasonings
based on these records; for, unfortunately, he did
not possess the means necessary for travelling and
making observations in the districts described by him.
Lyell acknowledges the great assistance afforded to
him by these two volumes of Von Hoff's work, but,
unlike that author, he was able to visit the various
localities referred to, and to draw his own conclusions
as to the nature of the changes which must have taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
place. It is pleasant to be able to relate that the debt
which he owed to Von Hoff was fully repaid by Lyell;
for the learned German's third volume appeared after
the issue of the <i>Principles of Geology</i>, and as Zittel
assures us 'its influence on Von Hoff is quite apparent
in the third volume of his work<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.'</p>

<p>At this period, too, Lyell had the advantage of
travelling both on the continent and in various parts
of Great Britain with the eminent French geologist,
Constant Prevost, who had shown his courage by
opposing some of the catastrophic teachings of the
illustrious Cuvier himself.</p>

<p>Still more important to Lyell were the opportunities
he enjoyed for comparing his conclusions
with those of Scrope, who had joined the Geological
Society in 1824, and became a joint secretary with
Lyell in the following year. From both of them, in
their old age, I heard many statements concerning the
closeness and warmth of their friendship, and the
constant interchange of ideas which took place
between them at this time.</p>

<p>From Scrope, Lyell heard of the occurrence of
great beds of freshwater limestone in the Auvergne,
on a far grander scale than in Strathmore, with many
other facts concerning the geology of Central France,
which so greatly excited him as in the end to alter
all his plans concerning the publication of his own
book. As soon as Scrope's great work on Auvergne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was published, Lyell undertook the preparation of
a review for the <i>Quarterly</i>&mdash;and this review was
a very able and discriminating production.</p>

<p>Although Lyell did not derive his views concerning
terrestrial evolution directly from Hutton,
as is sometimes supposed, there were two respects
in which he greatly profited when he came to read
Hutton's work at a later date.</p>

<p>In the first place, he was very deeply impressed
by the necessity of avoiding the <i>odium theologicum</i>,
which had been so strongly, if unintentionally, aroused
by Hutton, of whom he wrote, 'I think he ran unnecessarily
counter to the feelings and prejudices of
the age. This is not courage or manliness in the
cause of Truth, nor does it promote progress. It
is an unfeeling disregard for the weakness of human
nature, for it is our nature (for what reason heaven
knows), but as <i>it is</i> constitutional in our minds, to
feel a morbid sensibility on matters of religious faith,
I conceive that the same right feeling which guards
us from outraging too violently the sentiments of our
neighbours in the ordinary concerns of the world and
its customs, should direct us still more so in this<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.'</p>

<p>In the second place, Lyell was warned by the fate
of Hutton's writings that it was hopeless to look
for success in combatting the prevailing geological
theories, unless he cultivated a literary style very
different from that of the <i>Theory of the Earth</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Lyell's father had to a great extent guided his son's
classical studies, and at Oxford, where Lyell took
a good degree in classics, he practised diligently both
prose and poetic composition. Lyell once told me
that his tutor Dalby (afterwards a Dean) had put
Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>
into his hand with certain passages marked as 'not
to be read.' When he had studied the whole work
(of course including the marked passages) he said
he conceived a profound admiration for the author's
literary skill&mdash;and this feeling he retained throughout
his after life. It is not improbable, indeed, that
Lyell learned from Gibbon that a 'frontal attack'
on a fortress of error is much less likely to succeed
than one of 'sap and mine.' Lyell was always most
careful in the composition of his works, sparing no
pains to make his meaning clear, while he aimed at
elegance of expression and logical sequence in the
presentation of his ideas. The weakness of his eyes
was a great difficulty to him, throughout his life,
and, when not employing an amanuensis, he generally
wrote stretched out on the floor or on a sofa, with his
eyes close to the paper.</p>

<p>The relation of Lyell's views to those of Hutton,
may best be described in the words of his contemporary,
Whewell, whose remarks written immediately
after the publication of the first volume of the
<i>Principles</i>, lose nothing in effectiveness from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
evident, if gentle, note of sarcasm running through
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Hutton for the purpose of getting his continents above water,
or manufacturing a chain of Alps or Andes, did not disdain to call
in something more than common volcanic eruptions which we read
of in newspapers from time to time. He was content to have
a period of paroxysmal action&mdash;an extraordinary convulsion in
the bowels of the earth&mdash;an epoch of general destruction and
violence, to usher in one of restoration and life. Mr Lyell throws
away all such crutches, he walks alone in the path of his speculations;
he requires no paroxysms, no extraordinary periods; he is
content to take burning mountains as he finds them; and, with
the assistance of the stock of volcanoes and earthquakes now on
hand, he undertakes to transform the earth from any one of its
geological conditions to any other. He requires time, no doubt;
he must not be hurried in his proceedings. But, if we will allow
him a free stage in the wide circuit of eternity, he will ask no
other favour; he will fight his undaunted way through formations,
transition and fl&ouml;tz&mdash;through oceanic and lacustrine
deposits; and does not despair of carrying us triumphantly
from the dark and venerable schist of Skiddaw, to the alternating
tertiaries of the Isle of Wight, or even to the more recent
shell-beds of the Sicilian coasts, whose antiquity is but, as it were,
of yester-myriad of years<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Never, surely, did words written in a tone of
banter constitute such real and effective praise!</p>

<p>But though it is certain that Lyell did not <i>derive</i>
his evolutionary views from Hutton, yet when he
came to write his historical introduction to the
<i>Principles</i>, he was greatly impressed by the proofs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of genius shown by the great Scotch philosopher,
and equally by the brilliant exposition of those views
by Playfair in his <i>Illustrations</i>. To the former he
gave unstinted praise for the breadth and originality
of his views, and to the latter for the eloquence of his
writings&mdash;adopting quotations chosen from these last,
indeed, as mottoes for his own work.</p>

<p>It is only just to add that for the violent prejudices
excited by some of his contemporaries against
Hutton's writings&mdash;as being directed against the
theological tenets of the day and therefore subversive
of religion&mdash;there is really no foundation whatever;
and every candid reader of the <i>Theory of the Earth</i>
must acquit its author of any such design. The
passage quoted on page 51 could only have been
written by Lyell at a time when he was still unacquainted
with Hutton's works, and was misled by
common report concerning them. It is interesting
to note, however, that the passage occurs in a letter
written in December 1827, that is after the first draft
of the <i>Principles of Geology</i> had been 'delivered to
the publisher,' and before the preparation of the
historical introduction, which would appear to have
led to the first perusal of Hutton's great work, and
that of his brilliant illustrator, Playfair.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>'THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY'</h3>


<p>We have seen that as early as the year 1817,
when he visited East Anglia, Lyell began to experience
vague doubts concerning the soundness of
the 'Catastrophist' doctrines, which had been so
strongly impressed upon him by Buckland. And
these doubts in the mind of the undergraduate of
twenty years of age gradually acquired strength and
definiteness during his frequent geological excursions,
at home and abroad, during the next ten years. At
what particular date the design was formed of writing
a book and attacking the predominant beliefs of his
fellow-geologists, we have no means of ascertaining
exactly; but from a letter written to his friend
Dr Mantell, we find that at one time Lyell contemplated
publishing a book in the form of 'Conversations
in Geology<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>,' without putting his name to it. This
was probably suggested by the manner in which
Copernicus and Galileo sought to circumvent theological
opposition in the case of Astronomical Theory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>But this plan appears to have been soon abandoned;
and by the end of the year 1827, when he
had reached the age of thirty, Lyell had sent to the
printer the first manuscript of the <i>Principles of
Geology</i>, proposing that it should appear in the
course of the following year in two octavo volumes<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>A great and sudden interruption to this plan
occurred however, for just at this time Lyell was
engaged in writing his review for the <i>Quarterly</i> of
Scrope's work on <i>The Geology of Central France</i>, and
while doing this his interest was so strongly aroused
by the accounts of the phenomena exhibited in the
Auvergne, that he was led for a time to abandon the
task of seeing his own book through the press; and,
having induced Murchison and his wife to accompany
him, set off on a visit to that wonderful district. He
also felt that, before completing the second part of his
book, he needed more information concerning the
Tertiary formations, especially in Italy.</p>

<p>Lyell had been very early convinced of the
supreme importance of travel to the geologist. In
a letter to his friend Murchison he said:&mdash;'We must
preach up travelling, as Demosthenes did "delivery"
as the first, second and third requisites for a modern
geologist, in the present adolescent state of the
science<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.'</p>

<p>And Professor Bonney has estimated that so far
did he himself practise what he preached, that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
less than one fourth of the period of his active life
was spent in travel<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>The joint excursion of Lyell and Murchison to
the Auvergne was destined to have great influence
on the minds of these pioneers in geological research;
both became satisfied from their studies that, with
respect to the excavation of the valleys of the
country, Scrope's conclusions were irresistible; and
in a joint memoir this position was stoutly maintained
by them.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice the impression made by
these two great geologists on one another during this
joint expedition.</p>

<p>Murchison wrote that he had seen in Lyell 'the
most scrupulous and minute fidelity of observation
combined with close application in the closet and
ceaseless exertion in the field<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.'</p>

<p>But I recollect that Lyell once told me how
difficult Murchison found it to restrain himself from
impatience, when his companion's attention was
drawn aside by his entomological ardour. In an
early letter, indeed, we find that Murchison often
expressed a wish that Lyell's sisters had been with
them to attend to the insect-collecting and thus leave
Lyell free for geological work<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Lyell informed me that
Murchison had rendered him a great service in
showing how much a geologist could accomplish by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
taking advantage of riding on horseback, and he
declared in his letters that he 'never had a better
man to work with than Murchison'; nevertheless he
ridiculed his 'keep-moving-go-it-if-it-kills-you' system
as&mdash;quoting from the elder Matthews&mdash;he called it<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>On parting from Murchison and his wife, after the
Auvergne tour, Lyell proceeded to Italy and for more
than a year he was busy studying the Tertiary
deposits of Lombardy, the Roman states, Naples
and Sicily, and conferring with the Italian geologists
and conchologists. Thus it came about that he was
not free to resume the task of seeing the <i>Principles</i>
through the press till February 1829.</p>

<p>Immediately after his return to England Lyell
was compelled, with the assistance of his companion
Murchison, to defend their conclusions concerning
the excavations of valleys by rivers from a determined
attack of Conybeare, who was backed up
by Buckland and Greenough; the old geologists
endeavoured to prove that the river Thames had
never had any part in the work of forming its
valley<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. It is interesting to find that, on this
occasion, Sedgwick, who was in the chair, was so
far influenced by the arguments brought forward
by the young men, as to lend some aid to those who
had come to be called the 'Fluvialists,' in contradistinction
to the 'Diluvialists'; he went so far as to
suggest that, with regard to the floods which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Catastrophist invoked, it would be wiser at present to
'doubt and not dogmatise<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.'</p>

<p>To what extent the MS. of the <i>Principles</i>, sent
to the publisher in 1827, was added to and altered
two years later, we have no means of knowing; but
that the work was to a great extent rewritten would
appear from a letter sent to Murchison by Lyell, just
before his return to England. In it, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My work is in part written, and all planned. It
will not pretend to give even an abstract of all that
is known in geology, but it will endeavour to establish
<i>the principle of reasoning</i> in the science; and all my
geology will come in as illustration of my views of
those principles, and as evidence strengthening the
system necessarily arising out of the admission of
such principles, which, as you know, are neither more
nor less than that <i>no causes whatever</i> have from the
earliest time to which we can look back to the present,
ever acted, but those that are <i>now acting</i>, and that
they never acted with different degrees of energy
from that which they now exert'; but in 1833, in
dedicating his third volume to Murchison, he refers
to the MS., completed in 1827, as a 'first sketch
only of my <i>Principles of Geology</i><a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.'</p>

<p>At one period, Lyell contemplated again delaying
publication till he had visited Iceland. In the end,
however, after declining to act as professor of geology
in the new 'University of London' (University College),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
he set himself down steadily to the task of seeing the
book through the press. It was at this time that
Lyell experienced a singular piece of good fortune,
comparable with that which befel Darwin thirty years
afterwards, by his book falling into the hands of a
very sympathetic reviewer. John Murray, who had
undertaken the publication of the <i>Principles</i>, was
also the publisher of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and
Lockhart, the editor of that publication, undertook
that an early notice of the book should appear, if the
proof-sheets were sent to the reviewer. Buckland
and Sedgwick were successively approached on the
subject of reviewing Lyell's book, but both declined
on the ground of 'want of time'; though I strongly
suspect that their real motive in refusing the task
was a disinclination to attack&mdash;as they would doubtless
have felt themselves compelled to do&mdash;a valued
personal friend. Conybeare was, fortunately, thought
to be out of the question, as Lockhart said he
'promises and does not perform in the reviewing line.'</p>

<p>Very fortunately at this juncture, Lockhart, who
was in the habit of attending the Geological Society
and listening to the debates (for as he used to say
to his friends whom he took with him from the
Athenaeum, 'though I don't care for geology, yet I
<i>do</i> like to see the fellows fight') thought of Scrope.
Although he had practically retired from the active
work of the Geological Society at this time, Scrope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was known as an effective writer, and, happily for
the progress of science, he undertook the review of
Lyell's book.</p>

<p>Although, of course, Lyell had no voice in the
choice of a reviewer for the <i>Principles</i>, yet he could
not fail to rejoice in the fact that it had fallen to his
friend, who so strongly sympathised with his views,
to introduce it to the public. While the book was
being printed and the review of it was in preparation,
a number of letters passed between Lyell and Scrope,
and the latter, before his death, gave me the carefully
treasured epistles of his friend, with the drafts of
some of his replies. These letters, some of which
have been published, throw much light on the difficulties
with which Lyell had to contend, and the
manner in which he strove to meet them.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, many of the leaders in
the Geological Society at that day besides being
strongly inclined to Wernerian and Cataclysmal views,
had an honest, however mistaken, dread lest geological
research should lead to results, apparently
not in harmony with the accounts given in Genesis
of the Creation and the Flood. Lyell, as this correspondence
shows, was most anxious to avoid exciting
either scientific or theological prejudice. He wrote,
'I conceived the idea five or six years ago' (that is
in 1824 or 5) that 'if ever the Mosaic geology could
be set down without giving offence, it would be in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
historical sketch<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>,' and 'I was afraid to point the
moral ... about Moses. Perhaps I should have been
tenderer about the Koran<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.' He further says 'full
<i>half</i> of my history and comments was cut out, and
even many facts, because either I, or Stokes, or
Broderip, felt that it was anticipating twenty or
thirty years of the march of honest feeling to declare
it undisguisedly<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.'</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the publication by
Scrope of his two long notices of the <i>Principles</i>
in the <i>Review</i> which was regarded as the champion
of orthodoxy, was most opportune. A very clear
sketch was given in these reviews of the leading
facts and the general line of argument; and at the
same time the allowing of prejudice or prepossession
to influence the judgment on such questions was very
gently deprecated<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>But Scrope's reviews did not by any means
consist of an indiscriminate advocacy of Lyell's
views. In one respect&mdash;that of the great importance
of subaerial action as contrasted with marine action&mdash;Scrope's
views were at this time in advance of
those of Lyell, and he called especial attention to the
direct effects produced by rain in the earth-pillars
of Botzen. These Lyell had not at the time seen,
but took an early opportunity of visiting. Scrope,
too, was naturally much more speculative in his modes
of thought than Lyell, and argued for the probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
greater intensity in past times of the agencies causing
geological change, and for the legitimacy of discussing
the mode of origin of the earth. Lyell, like Hutton,
argued that he saw '<i>no signs</i> of a beginning,' but his
characteristic candour is shown when he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>'All I ask is, that at any given period of the past,
don't stop enquiry, when puzzled, by a reference to
a "beginning," which is all one with "another state of
nature," as it appears to me. But there is no harm
in your attacking me, provided you point out that
it is the <i>proof</i> I deny, not the <i>probability</i> of a
beginning<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.'</p>

<p>Lyell clearly foresaw the opposition with which
his book would be met and wisely resolved not to be
drawn into controversy. He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I daresay I shall not keep my resolution, but
I will try to do it firmly, that when my book is
attacked ... I will not go to the expense of time in
pamphleteering. I shall work steadily on Vol. II,
and afterwards, if the work succeeds, at edition 2,
and I have sworn to myself that I will not go to the
expense of giving time to combat in controversy. It
is interminable work<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.'</p>

<p>In order to maintain this resolve, Lyell, the
moment the last sheet of the volume was corrected,
set off for a four months' tour in France and Spain.
While absent from England, he heard little of what
was going on in the scientific world; but, on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
return, Lyell was told by Murray that in the three
months before the <i>Quarterly Review</i> article appeared,
650 copies of the volume, out of the 1500 printed,
had been sold, and he anticipated the disposal of
many more, when the review came out. This expectation
was realised and led to the issue of a
second edition of the first volume, of larger size
and in better type.</p>

<p>Lyell, from the first, had seen that it would be
impossible to avoid the conclusion that the principles
which he was advancing with respect to the inorganic
world must be equally applicable to the organic world.
At first he only designed to touch lightly on this
subject, in the concluding chapters of his first volume,
and to devote the second volume to the application
of his principles to the interpretation of the geological
record. He, however, found it impossible to include
the chapters on changes in the organic world in the
first volume and then decided to make them the
opening portion of the second volume.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that as the work progressed,
the interest of the various questions bearing on the
origin of species grew in his mind. While Lyell found
it impossible to accept the explanation of origin suggested
by Lamarck, he was greatly influenced by the
arguments in favour of evolution advanced by that
naturalist; and as he wrote chapter after chapter on
the questions of the modification and variability of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
species, on hybridity, on the modes of distribution of
plants and animals, and their consequent geographical
relations, and discussed the struggle of existence
going on everywhere in the organic world, in its
bearings on the question of 'centres of creation,' he
found the second volume growing altogether beyond
reasonable limits. His intense interest in this part
of his work is shown by his remark, 'If I have succeeded
so well with inanimate matter, surely I shall
make a lively thing when I have chiefly to talk of
living beings<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>?'</p>

<p>By December 1831, Lyell had come to the resolution
to publish the chapters of his work which dealt
with the changes going on in the organic world as
a volume by itself. This second volume of the
<i>Principles</i> he gracefully dedicated to his friend
Broderip, who had rendered him such valuable assistance
in all questions connected with Natural History.</p>

<p>This volume appeared in January 1832, at the
same time that a second edition of the first volume
was also issued. The reception of the second volume
by the public appears to have been not less favourable
than that of the first.</p>

<p>In March 1831, Lyell had accepted the Professorship
of Geology in King's College, London.
In addition to his desire to aid in the work of
scientific education, in which he had always taken so
great an interest, Lyell seems to have felt that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
task of presenting his views in a popular form would
be aided by his having to expound them to a miscellaneous
audience. For two years, these lectures
were delivered, and attracted much attention; the
favourable impressions produced by them on a man of
the world have been recorded by Abraham Hayward,
and on more scientific thinkers by Harriet Martineau.</p>

<p>The third volume of the <i>Principles</i> was not
completed till a second edition of the second volume
had been issued. This third volume, appearing in
May 1833, dealt with the classification of the Tertiary
strata, to which Lyell had devoted so much labour,
studying conchology under Deshayes, and visiting all
the chief Tertiary deposits of Europe for the collection
of materials. The application of the principles
enunciated in the two earlier volumes to the unravelling
of the past history of the globe, constituted
the chief task undertaken in this part of the great
work. But not a few controversial questions were
dealt with, and the famous 'metamorphic theory'
was advanced in opposition to the Wernerian hypothesis
of 'primitive formations.' The volume was
appropriately dedicated to Murchison, who had been
Lyell's companion in the famous Auvergne excursion,
which had produced such an effect on his mind.</p>

<p>Within a twelvemonth, a third edition of the
whole work in four small volumes was issued, and in
the end no less than twelve editions of the <i>Principles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of Geology</i> were issued, in addition to portions
separately published under the titles of <i>Manual</i>,
<i>Elements</i>, and <i>Student's Elements of Geology</i>, of all
of which a number of editions have appeared. Lyell
was always the most painstaking and conscientious
of authors. He declared 'I must write what will be
read<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>,' and he spared no labour in securing accuracy
of statement combined with elegance of diction. His
father, a good classical and Italian scholar, had done
much towards assisting him to attain literary excellence,
and at Oxford, where he took a good degree
in classics, he was greatly impressed by the style of
Gibbon's writings, and practised both prose and
poetic compositions with great diligence.</p>

<p>Both Darwin and Huxley always maintained that
the real charm and power of Lyell's work are only to
be found in the <i>first edition</i><a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. As new discoveries
were made or more effective illustrations of his views
presented themselves to his mind, passage after
passage in the work was modified by the author
or replaced by others; and the effects of these
constant changes&mdash;however necessary and desirable
in themselves&mdash;could not fail to be detrimental to
the book as a work of art. He who would form a
just idea of the greatness of Lyell's masterpiece,
must read the first edition, of course bearing in
mind, all the while, the state of science at the time
it was written.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF LYELL'S WORKS</h3>


<p>Although the <i>Principles of Geology</i> was received
by the public with something like enthusiasm&mdash;due
to the cogency of its reasoning and the charm of its
literary style&mdash;there were not wanting critics who
attacked the author on the ground of his heterodox
views. It had come to be so generally understood,
that every expression of geological opinion should,
by way of apology, be accompanied by an attempt
to 'harmonise' it with the early chapters of Genesis,
that the absence of any references of this kind was
asserted to be a proof of 'infidelity' on the part of
the author.</p>

<p>But Lyell's sincere and earnest efforts to avoid
exciting theological prejudice, and the striking
illustrations, which he gave in his historical introduction,
of the absurdities that had resulted from
these prejudices in the past, were not without effect.
This was shown in a somewhat remarkable manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in 1831, when, in response to an invitation given to
him, he consented to become a candidate for the
Chair of Geology at King's College, London, then
recently founded.</p>

<p>The election was in the hands of an Archbishop,
two Bishops and two Doctors of Divinity, and Lyell
relates their decision, as communicated to him, in
the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'They considered some of my doctrines startling enough, but
could not find that they were come by otherwise than in a straightforward
manner, and (as <i>I</i> appeared to think) logically deducible
from the facts, so that whether the facts were true or not, or my
conclusions logical or otherwise, there was no reason to infer that
I had made my theory from any hostile feeling towards revelation<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>The appointment was, in the end, made with only
one dissentient, and it is pleasing to find that Conybeare,
the most determined opponent of Lyell's evolutionary
views, was extremely active in his efforts in
his support. The result was equally honourable to all
parties, and affords a pleasing proof of the fact that
in the half century which had elapsed since the
persecution of Priestley and Hutton, theological
rancour must have greatly declined. But while
the reception of the <i>Principles of Geology</i> by the
general public was of such a generally satisfactory
character, Lyell had to acknowledge that his reasoning
had but little effect in modifying the views of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
distinguished contemporaries in the Geological
Society.</p>

<p>The admiration felt for the author's industry and
skill, in the collection and marshalling of facts and
of the observations made by him in his repeated
travels, were eloquently expressed by the generous
Sedgwick, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Were I to tell "the author" of the instruction I received from
every chapter of his work, and of the delight with which I rose
from the perusal of the whole, I might seem to flatter rather than
to speak the language of sober criticism; but I should only give
utterance to my honest sentiments. His work has already taken,
and will long maintain a distinguished place in the philosophic
literature of this country<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Nevertheless, in the same address to the Geological
Society, in which these words were spoken,
Sedgwick goes on to argue forcibly against the
doctrine of continuity, and to assert his firm belief
in the occurrence of frequent interruptions of the
geological record by great convulsions.</p>

<p>Whewell was equally enthusiastic with Sedgwick,
concerning the value of the body of facts collected
by Lyell, declaring that he had established a new
branch of science, 'Geological Dynamics'; but he
also believed with Sedgwick, that the evolutionary
doctrine was as obnoxious to true science as he
thought it was to Scripture.</p>

<p>These were the views of all the great leaders of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
geological science at that day, and in 1834, after the
completion of the <i>Principles</i>, when a great discussion
took place in the Geological Society on the subject
of the effects ascribed by him to existing causes,
Lyell says that 'Buckland, De la Beche, Sedgwick,
Whewell, and some others treated them with as
much ridicule as was consistent with politeness in
my presence<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.'</p>

<p>It is interesting to be able to infer from Lyell's
accounts of these days, that the sagacious De la
Beche was beginning to weaken in his opposition to
evolutionary views, and that Fitton and John Phillips
were inclined to support him, but neither of them
was ready to come forward boldly as the champions
of unpopular opinions. John Herschel, who sympathised
with Lyell in all his opinions, was absent
at the Cape, Scrope was absorbed in the stormy
politics of that day, and it was not till Darwin
returned from his South American voyage in 1838,
that Lyell found any staunch supporter in the frequent
lively debates at the Geological Society.</p>

<p>It is pleasing, however, to relate that this strong
opposition to his theoretical teachings, did not lessen
the esteem, or interfere with the friendship, felt for
Lyell by his contemporaries. During all this time
he held the office of Foreign Secretary to the Society,
and in 1835 was elected President, retaining the office
for two years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The general feeling of the old geologists with
respect to Lyell's opinions was very exactly expressed
by Professor Henslow, when in parting from
young Darwin on his setting out on his voyage, he
referred to the recently published first volume of the
<i>Principles</i> in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Take Lyell's new book with you and read it by
all means, for it is very interesting, but do not pay
any attention to it, except in regard to facts, for it is
altogether wild as far as theory goes.'</p>

<p>(I quote the words as repeated to me by Darwin,
in a conversation I had with him on August 7th, 1880,
of which I made a note at the time. Darwin has
himself referred to this conversation with Henslow
in his autobiography<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.)</p>

<p>Except in a few cases, this was the attitude
maintained by all the old geologists who were Lyell's
contemporaries. Even as late as 1895 we find the
amiable Prestwich protesting strongly against 'the
<i>Fetish</i> of uniformity<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>,' and I well remember about
the same time being solemnly warned by a geologist
of the old school against 'poor old Lyell's fads.'</p>

<p>It was not, indeed, till a new generation of geologists
had arisen, including Godwin-Austen, Edward
Forbes, Ramsay, Jukes, Darwin, Hooker and Huxley,
that the real value and importance of Lyell's teaching
came to be recognised and acknowledged.</p>

<p>The most important influence of Lyell's great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
work is seen, however, in the undoubted fact that it
inspired the men, who became the leaders in the
revolution of thought which took place a quarter of
a century later in respect to the organic world.
Were I to assert that if the <i>Principles of Geology</i>
had not been written, we should never have had the
<i>Origin of Species</i>, I think I should not be going too
far: at all events, I can safely assert, from several
conversations I had with Darwin, that he would have
most unhesitatingly agreed in that opinion.</p>

<p>Darwin's devotion to his 'dear master' as he
used to call Lyell, was of the most touching character,
and it was prominently manifested in all his geological
conversations. In his books and in his letters he
never failed to express his deep indebtedness to his
'own true love' as he called the <i>Principles of
Geology</i>. In what was Darwin's own most favourite
work, the <i>Narrative of the Voyage of the Beagle</i>, he
wrote 'To Charles Lyell, Esq., F.R.S., this second
edition is dedicated with grateful pleasure, as an
acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever
scientific merit this Journal and the other works of
the author may possess, has been derived from studying
the well-known, admirable <i>Principles of Geology</i>.'</p>

<p>How Lyell's first volume inspired Darwin with his
passion for geological research, and how his second
volume was one of the determining causes in turning
his mind in the direction of Evolution, we shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
see in the sequel. In 1844, Darwin wrote to Leonard
Horner how 'forcibly impressed I am with the
infinite superiority of the Lyellian School of Geology
over the continental,' he even says, 'I always feel as
if my books came half out of Lyell's brain'; adding
'I have always thought that the great merit of the
<i>Principles</i> was that it altered the whole tone of one's
mind, and therefore that, when seeing a thing never
seen by Lyell one yet saw it partially through his
eyes<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.' About the same time Darwin wrote, 'I am
much pleased to hear of the call for a new edition of
the <i>Principles</i>: what glorious good that work has
done<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>!' And in the <i>Origin of Species</i> he gives his
deliberate verdict on the book, referring to it as
'Lyell's grand work on the <i>Principles of Geology</i>,
which the future historian will recognise as having
produced a revolution in Natural Science<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.'</p>

<p>Darwin seemed always afraid, such was his
sensitive and generous nature, that he did not
sufficiently acknowledge his indebtedness to Lyell.
He wrote to his friend in 1845:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I have long wished not so much for your sake as for my own
feelings of honesty, to acknowledge more plainly than by mere
reference, how much I geologically owe you. Those authors,
however, who like you educate people's minds as well as teach
them special facts, can never, I should think, have full justice
done them except by posterity, for the mind thus insensibly
improved can hardly perceive its own upward ascent.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Very heartily, as I can bear witness from long
intercourse with him, was this deep affection of
Darwin reciprocated by the man who was addressed
by him in his letters as 'Your affectionate pupil.'
But a stranger who conversed with Lyell would have
thought that he was the junior and a disciple; so
profound was his reverence for the genius of Darwin.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Lyell's extreme
caution in statement, and his candour in admitting
and replying to objections, had much to do with his
acquirement of that authority with general, no less
than with scientific, readers, which he so long enjoyed.
In his candour he resembled his friend Darwin; but
his caution was carried so far that, even after full
conviction had entered his mind on a subject, he
would still hesitate to avow that conviction. He was
always obsessed by a feeling that there still <i>might be</i>
objections, which he had not foreseen and met, and
therefore felt it unsafe to declare himself. No doubt
the peculiarly trying circumstances under which his
work was written&mdash;a seemingly hopeless protest
against ideas held unswervingly by teachers and
fellow-workers&mdash;led to the creation in him of this
habit of mind.</p>

<p>Darwin, with all his candour, was of a far more
sanguine and optimistic temperament than Lyell, and
the difference between them, in this respect, often
comes out in their correspondence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Darwin, from the horrors he had witnessed
in South America, had come to entertain a most
fanatical hatred of slavery&mdash;his abhorrence of which
he used to express in most unmeasured terms. Lyell,
in his travels in the Southern United States, was equally
convinced of the undesirability of the institution;
but he thought it just to state the grounds on which
it was defended, by those who had been his hosts in
the Slave-states. Even this, however, was too much
for Darwin, and he felt that he must 'explode' to
his friend 'How could you relate so placidly that
atrocious sentiment' (it was of course only quoted
by Lyell) 'about separating children from their
parents; and in the next page speak of being
distressed at the whites not having prospered: I
assure you the contrast made me exclaim out. But
I have broken my intention (that is not to write
about the matter), so no more of this odious deadly
subject<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.'</p>

<p>It was just the same in their mode of viewing
scientific questions. Thus in 1838, while they were
in the midst of the fierce battle with the 'Old
Guard' at the Geological Society, Lyell wrote to his
brother-in-arms as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I really find, when bringing up my Preliminary Essays in
<i>Principles</i> to the science of the present day, so far as I know it,
that the great outline, and even most of the details, stand so
uninjured, and in many cases they are so much strengthened by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
new discoveries, especially by yours, that we may begin to hope
that the great principles there insisted on will stand the test of
new discoveries<a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>To which the younger and more ardent Darwin
warmly replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>Begin to hope</i>: why, the <i>possibility</i> of a doubt has never
crossed my mind for many a day. This may be very unphilosophical,
but my geological salvation is staked on it ... it makes
me quite indignant that you should talk of <i>hoping</i><a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>When talking with Lyell at this time about the
opposition of the old school of geologists to their
joint views, Darwin said, 'What a good thing it
would be if every scientific man was to die at sixty
years old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose
all new doctrines<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.'</p>

<p>In conversations that I had with him late in life,
Darwin several times remarked to me, that 'he had
seen so many of his friends make fools of themselves
by putting forward new theoretical views in their old
age, that he had resolved quite early in life, never to
publish any speculative opinions after he was sixty.'
But both in conversation and in his writings he always
maintained that Lyell was an exception to all such
rules, seeing that at last he adopted the theory of
Natural Selection in his old age, thus displaying the
most 'remarkable candour.'</p>

<p>All who had the pleasure of discussing geological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
questions with Lyell will recognise the truth of the
portrait drawn of his old friend by Darwin, about a
year before his own death.</p>

<p>He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by
clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality.
When I made a remark to him on Geology, he never rested until
he saw the whole case clearly, and often made me see it more
clearly than I had done before.'</p></div>

<p>And he sums up his admiration of the 'dear old
master' in the words</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell&mdash;more
so, as I believe, than to any other man who ever lived<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Alfred Russel Wallace is scarcely less emphatic
than Charles Darwin himself in his expression of
affection and admiration for Lyell, and his indebtedness
to the <i>Principles of Geology</i>.</p>

<p>In his Autobiography, Wallace writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'With Sir Charles I soon felt at home, owing to his refined
and gentle manners, his fund of quiet humour, and his intense
love and extensive knowledge of natural science. His great
liberality of thought and wide general interests were also
attractive to me; and although when he had once arrived at a
definite conclusion, he held by it very tenaciously until a considerable
body of well-ascertained facts could be adduced against
it, yet he was always willing to listen to the arguments of his
opponents, and to give them careful and repeated consideration<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the influence of the <i>Principles of Geology</i> in
leading him to evolution, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Along with Malthus I had read, and been even more deeply
impressed by, Sir Charles Lyell's immortal <i>Principles of Geology</i>;
which had taught me that the inorganic world&mdash;the whole surface
of the earth, its seas and lands, its mountains and valleys, its
rivers and lakes, and every detail of its climatic conditions&mdash;were
and always had been in a continual state of slow modification.
Hence it became obvious that the forms of life must have become
continually adjusted to these changed conditions in order to
survive. The succession of fossil remains throughout the whole
geological series of rocks is the record of the change; and it
became easy to see that the extreme slowness of these changes
was such as to allow ample opportunity for the continuous
automatic adjustment of the organic to the inorganic world, as
well as of each organism to every other organism in the same
area, by the simple processes of "variation and survival of the
fittest." Thus was the fundamental idea of the "origin of
species" logically formulated from the consideration of a series of
well ascertained facts<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Nor were the two men (who, like Aaron and Hur
so steadily sustained the hands of Darwin in his long
vigil), behind the two authors of Natural Selection
themselves in their devotion to Lyell. How touching
is Hooker's tribute of affection on the death of his
friend, 'My loved, my best friend, for well nigh forty
years of my life. To me the blank is fearful, for it
never will, never can be filled up. The most generous
sharer of my own and my family's hopes, joys, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
sorrows, whose affection for me was truly that of a
father and brother combined<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.'</p>

<p>And Huxley speaking of Lyell, the day after his
death said, 'Sir Charles Lyell would be known in
history as the greatest geologist of his time. Some
days ago I went to my venerable friend, and put
before him the results of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition.
Nothing could then have been more touching than
the conflict between the mind and the material body,
the brain clear and comprehending all; while the
lips could hardly express the views which the busy
mind formed<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.'</p>

<p>How well do I recollect my last visit to Lyell a
day or two after this farewell interview with Huxley,
the glow of gratitude which lighted up the noble
features as with trembling lips he told me how
'Huxley had repeated his whole Royal Institution
lecture at his bedside.'</p>

<p>Huxley was a most devoted student of Lyell.
Speaking to his fellow geologists in 1869 he said,
'Which of us has not thumbed every page of the
<i>Principles of Geology</i><a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>?' and writing in 1887 on the
reception of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I have recently read afresh the first edition of the <i>Principles
of Geology</i>; and when I consider that this remarkable book had
been nearly thirty years in everybody's hands, and that it brings
home to any reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a
great fact&mdash;the principle, that the past must be explained by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
present, unless good cause be shown to the contrary; and the
fact, that, so far as our knowledge of the past history of life on
our globe goes, no such cause can be shown&mdash;I cannot but believe
that Lyell, for others, as for myself, was the chief agent in
smoothing the road for Darwin. For consistent uniformitarianism
postulates evolution as much in the organic as in the inorganic
world. The origin of a new species by other than ordinary
agencies would be a vastly greater 'catastrophe' than any of those
which Lyell successfully eliminated from sober geological speculation<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>How strongly Lyell had become convinced, as
early as 1832, of the truth and importance of the
doctrine of Evolution&mdash;in the <i>organic</i> as well as in
the inorganic world&mdash;in spite of his emphatic rejection
of the theory of Lamarck, we shall show in the
next chapter. It was this conviction, as we shall see,
which led to his friendly encouragement of Darwin
in his persevering investigations and to his constant
solicitude that the results of his friend's labours
should not be lost through delay in their publication.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>


<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>EARLY ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH THE DOCTRINE
OF EVOLUTION FOR THE ORGANIC WORLD</h3>


<p>In studying the history of Evolutionary ideas, it
is necessary to keep in mind that there are two
perfectly distinct lines of thought, the origin and
development of which have to be considered.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The conviction that species are not immutable,
but that, by some means or other, new
forms of life are derived from pre-existing ones.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The conception of some process or
processes, by which this change of old forms into
new ones may be explained.</p>

<p>Buffon, Kant, Goethe, and many other philosophic
thinkers, have been more or less firmly persuaded of
the truth of the first of these propositions; and even
Linnaeus himself was ready to make admissions in
this direction. It was impossible for anyone who was
convinced of the truth of the doctrine of continuity
or evolution in the <i>inorganic</i> world, to avoid the
speculation that the same arguments by which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
truth of that doctrine was maintained must apply
also to the <i>organic</i> world.</p>

<p>Hence we find that directly the <i>Principles of
Geology</i> was published, thinkers, like Sedgwick and
Whewell, at once taxed Lyell with holding that 'the
creation of new species is going on at the present
day,' and Lyell replied to the latter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'It was impossible, I think, for anyone to read my work and
not to perceive that my notion of uniformity in the existing causes
of change always implied that they must for ever produce an
endless variety of effects, <i>both in the animate and inanimate
world</i><a name="FNanchor_80_81" id="FNanchor_80_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_81" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>And to Sedgwick, Lyell wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Now touching my opinion,' concerning the creation of new
species at the present day, 'I have no right to object, <i>as I really
entertain it</i>, to your controverting it; at the same time you will
see, on reading my chapter on the subject, that I have studiously
avoided laying down the doctrine dogmatically as capable of proof.
I have admitted that we have only data for <i>extinction</i>, and I have
left it to be inferred, instead of enunciating it even as my opinion,
that the place of lost species is filled up (as it was of old) from
time to time by new species. I have only ventured to say that
had new mammalia come in, we could hardly have hoped to verify
the fact<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>That Lyell was convinced of the truth of the
doctrine of the evolution of species is shown by his
correspondence with friends and sympathisers like
Scrope and John Herschel. But he wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'If I had stated ... the possibility of the introduction or
origination of fresh species being a natural, in contradistinction
to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host of prejudices
against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every step to
any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these
mysterious subjects<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>That Lyell was justified in not increasing the
difficulties which would retard the reception of his
views, by introducing matter, which he still regarded
as of a more or less speculative character, I think
everyone will be prepared to admit. Darwin had
to contend with the same difficulty in writing the
<i>Origin of Species</i>. To have included the question
of the origin of mankind <i>prominently</i> in that work
would have raised an almost insurmountable barrier
to its reception. He says in his autobiography,
'I thought it best, in order that no honourable man
should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that
by the work "light would be thrown on the origin of
man and his history." It would have been useless
and injurious to the success of the book to have
paraded, without giving evidence, my conviction with
respect to his origin<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.'</p>

<p>Huxley and Haeckel have both borne testimony
to the fact that Lyell, at the time he wrote the
<i>Principles</i>, was firmly convinced that new species
had originated by evolution from old ones. Indeed
in a letter to John Herschel in 1836 he goes very far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
in the direction of anticipating the lines in which
enquiries on the <i>method</i> of evolution must proceed,
having even a prevision of the doctrine of <i>mimicry</i>,
long afterwards established by Bates and others.
Lyell wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad
to find that you think it probable that it may be carried on
through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this rather
to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to offend a certain class
of persons by embodying in words what would only be a speculation....
One can in imagination summon before us a small part
at least of the circumstances that must be contemplated and
foreknown, before it can be decided what powers and qualities a
new species must have in order to enable it to endure for a given
time, and to play its part in due relation to all other beings
destined to coexist with it, before it dies out.... It may be seen
that unless some slight additional precaution be taken, the species
about to be born would at a certain era be reduced to too low a
number. There may be a thousand modes of ensuring its
duration beyond that time; one, for example, may be the
rendering it more prolific, but this would perhaps make it press
too hard upon other species at other times. Now if it be an
insect it may be made in one of its transformations to resemble a
dead stick, or a leaf, or a lichen, or a stone, so as to be somewhat
less easily found by its enemies; or if this would make it too
strong, an occasional variety of the species may have this
advantage conferred on it; or if this would be still too much,
one sex of a certain variety. Probably there is scarcely a dash
of colour on the wing or body of which the choice would be quite
arbitrary, or which might not affect its duration for thousands of
years. I have been told that the leaf-like expansions of the
abdomen and thighs of a certain Brazilian Mantis turn from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
green to yellow as autumn advances, together with the leaves of
plants among which it seeks its prey. Now if species come in
succession, such contrivances must sometimes be made, and such
relations predetermined between species, as the Mantis, for
example, and plants not then existing, but which it was foreseen
would exist together with some particular climate at a given
time. But I cannot do justice to this train of speculation in a
letter, and will only say that it seems to me to offer a more
beautiful subject for reasoning and reflecting on, than the notion
of great batches of new species all coming in and afterwards
going out at once<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>We have cited this very remarkable passage, as it
affords striking evidence of how deeply Lyell had
thought on this great question at a very early period.
Nevertheless it is certain that when he wrote the
second volume of the <i>Principles</i>, he had not been
able to satisfy himself that any hypothesis of the
<i>mode</i> of evolution, that had up to that time been
suggested, could be regarded as satisfactory.</p>

<p>The only serious attempt to <i>explain</i> the derivation
of new species from old ones that came before Lyell
was that of the illustrious Lamarck.</p>

<p>Very noteworthy was the work of that old
wounded French soldier, afflicted in his later years
as he was by blindness. By his early labours,
Lamarck had attained a considerable reputation
as a botanist, and later in life he turned his attention
to zoology, and then to palaeontology and geology.
In zoology, he did for the study of invertebrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
animals what his great contemporary Cuvier was
accomplishing for the vertebrates; but, with regard
to the origin of species, he arrived at conclusions
directly at variance with those of his distinguished
rival.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Professor Osborn<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> for calling
attention to that remarkable, but little known work
of Lamarck's&mdash;<i>Hydrog&eacute;ologie</i>&mdash;published in 1802,
seven years before his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> appeared.
This work is especially interesting as showing
to how great an extent&mdash;as in the case of Darwin,
Wallace and others&mdash;it was geological phenomena
which played an important part in leading Lamarck
to evolutionary convictions. "In Geology," Professor
Osborn writes,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Lamarck was an ardent advocate of uniformity, as against
the Cataclysmal School. The main principles are laid down in
his <i>Hydrog&eacute;ologie</i>, that all the revolutions of the earth are extremely
slow. "For Nature," he says, "time is nothing. It is never
a difficulty, she always has it at her disposal; and it is for her
the means by which she has accomplished the greatest as well as
the least results<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>."'</p></div>

<p>On the subject of subaerial denudation (the action
of rain and rivers in wearing down the earth's surface),
Lamarck's views were as clear and definite as those
of Hutton himself; though it is almost certain that
he could never have seen, or even heard of, the
writings of the great Scottish philosopher. On some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
other questions of geological dynamics, however, it
must be confessed that Lamarck's views and speculations
were rather crude and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>, published in the
same year that Charles Darwin was born (1809),
Lamarck brought forward a great body of evidence
in favour of evolution, derived from his extensive
knowledge of botany, zoology and geology. He
showed how complete was the gradation between
many forms ranked as species, and how difficult it
was to say what forms should be classed as 'varieties'
and what as 'species.'</p>

<p>But when he came to indicate a possible method
by which one species might be derived from another,
he was less happy in his suggestions. He recognised
the value of the evidence derived from the study of
the races which have arisen among domestic animals,
and from the crossing of different forms. But his
main argument was derived from the acknowledged
fact that use or disuse may cause the development
or the partial atrophy of organs&mdash;the case of the
'blacksmith's arm.' Unfortunately some of the
suggestions made by Lamarck, in this connexion&mdash;like
that of the elongation of the giraffe's neck to
enable it to browse on high trees&mdash;were of a kind
that made them very susceptible to ridicule. His
theory was of course dependent on the admission that
acquired characters were transmitted from parents to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
children, and in the absence of any suggestion of
'selection,' it did not appeal strongly to thinkers on
this question.</p>

<p>Lyell first became acquainted with the writings
of Lamarck in 1827. As he was returning from the
Oxford circuit for the last time&mdash;having now resolved
to give up law and devote himself to geological work
exclusively&mdash;he wrote to his friend Mantell as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I devoured Lamarck <i>en voyage</i>.... His theories delighted me
more than any novel I ever read, and much in the same way, for
they address themselves to the imagination, at least of geologists
who know the mighty inferences which would be deducible were
they established by observations. But though I admire even his
flights, and feel none of the <i>odium theologicum</i> which some
modern writers in this country have visited him with, I confess I
read him rather as I hear an advocate on the wrong side, to know
what can be made of the case in good hands. I am glad he has
been courageous enough and logical enough to admit that his
argument, if pushed as far as it must go, if worth anything, would
prove that men may have come from the Ourang-Outang. But
after all, what changes species may really undergo! How
impossible will it be to distinguish and lay down a line, beyond
which some of the so-called extinct species have never passed
into recent ones. That the earth is quite as old as he supposes,
has long been my creed, and I will try before six months are over
to convert the readers of the <i>Quarterly</i> to that heterodox
opinion<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Lyell was at that time at work on his review for
the <i>Quarterly</i> of Scrope's <i>Central France</i>, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
also completing the 'first sketch' of the <i>Principles</i>.
But it is evident that as the result of continued study
of Lamarck's book, Lyell found it, in spite of its
fascination, to embody a theory which he could not
but regard as unsound and not calculated to prove a
solution of the great mystery of evolution. Accordingly
when the second volume of the <i>Principles</i> was
issued in 1832, it was found to contain in its opening
chapters a very trenchant criticism of Lamarck's
theory.</p>

<p>It is only fair to remember, however, that in
1863, after Lyell had accepted the theory of Natural
Selection he wrote to Darwin:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'When I came to the conclusion that after all Lamarck was
going to be shown to be right, and that we must "go the whole
orang" I re-read his book, and remembering when it was written, I
felt I had done him injustice<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>It is interesting also to notice that Darwin, like
Lyell, gradually came to entertain a higher opinion
of the merit of Lamarck's works, than he did on his
first perusal of them. In 1844, Darwin wrote to
Hooker, 'Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense!'
and in the same year he speaks of Lamarck's
book as 'veritable rubbish,' an 'absurd though
clever work<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.' When, after the publication of the
<i>Origin of Species</i>, Lyell referred to the <i>conclusions</i>
arrived at in that work as similar to those of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Lamarck, Darwin expressed something like indignation,
and he wrote to their 'mutual friend'
Hooker, 'I have grumbled a bit in my answer to
him' (Lyell) 'at his <i>always</i> classing my book as a
modification of Lamarck's, which it is no more than
any author who did not believe in the immutability
of species<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.' In this case, as is so frequently seen in
the writings of Darwin, it is evident that he attaches
infinitely less importance to the establishment of the
<i>fact</i> of the evolution of species, than to the demonstration
of a possible <i>mode of origin</i> of that evolution.
But that later in life Darwin came to take a more
indulgent view of the result of Lamarck's labours is
shown by a passage in his 'Historical Sketch'
prefixed to the <i>Origin</i>, in 1866. Lamarck, he says,
'first did the eminent service of arousing attention
to the probability of all change in the organic world,
as well as in the inorganic world, being the result of
law and not of miraculous interposition<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.'</p>

<p>In the opinion of Dr Schwalbe and others there
are indications in Darwin's later writings that he had
come into much closer relation with the views of
Lamarck, than was the case when he wrote the
<i>Origin</i><a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>It is interesting, however, to note that Erasmus
Darwin, the grandfather of Charles, published
independently and contemporaneously, views on the
nature and causes of evolution in striking agreement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with those of Lamarck; but perhaps the poetical
form, in which he chose to embody his ideas, led to
their receiving less attention than they deserved.</p>

<p>As is now well known a number of writers during
the earlier years of the nineteenth century published
statements in favour of evolutionary views, and in
several cases the theory of natural selection was
more or less distinctly outlined. In addition to
Geoffroy and Isidore Saint Hilaire and d'Omalius
d'Halloy on the continent, a number of writers
in this country, such as Dr Wells, Mr Patrick
Matthew, Dr Pritchard, Professor Grant, Dean
Herbert, all expressed views in favour of evolution,
even, in some cases, foreshadowing Natural Selection
as the method. But these authors attached so little
importance to their suggestions, that they did not
even take the trouble to place them on permanent
record, and it is certain that neither Lyell nor
Darwin was acquainted with their writings at the
time they were themselves working at the subject.</p>

<p>There was indeed one work which, during the
time that the <i>Origin of Species</i> was in preparation,
attracted much popular attention. In 1844, Robert
Chambers, who was favourably known as the author
of some geological papers, wrote a book which
excited a great amount of attention&mdash;the well-known
<i>Vestiges of Creation</i>. This work was a very bold
pronouncement of evolutionary views. Beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
with a statement of the nebular hypothesis of Kant
and Laplace, it discussed the question of the origin
of life&mdash;when life became possible on a cooling
globe&mdash;and, arguing strongly in favour of the view
that all plants and animals, as the conditions under
which they existed change, had given rise to new
forms, better adapted to their environment, insisted
that the whole living creation had been gradually
developed from the simplest types.</p>

<p>Chambers published his book anonymously, being
naturally afraid of the prejudices that would be
excited against him&mdash;especially in his own country&mdash;by
a work so outspoken, and it was not till after his
death that its authorship was definitely known.</p>

<p>The <i>Vestiges of Creation</i> met with very different
receptions at the hands of the general public and
from the scientific world, at the time it was published.
The former were startled but captivated by its fearless
statements and suggestive lines of thought;
while the latter were repelled and incensed by the
want of judgment, too frequently shown, in accepting
as indisputable, facts and experiments which
really rested on a very slender basis or none at all.
So popular was the book, however, that it passed
through twelve editions, the last being published
after the appearance of the <i>Origin of Species</i>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to read Darwin's judgment in
later life on this once famous book; he says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The work from its powerful and brilliant style, though
displaying in the earlier editions little accurate knowledge and a
great want of scientific caution, immediately had a very wide
circulation. In my opinion it has done excellent service in this
country in calling attention to the subject, in removing prejudice,
and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous
views<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>If we enquire what was the attitude of scientific
naturalists towards the doctrine of Evolution, immediately
before the occurrence of the events to be
recorded in the next chapter, we shall find some
diversity of opinion to exist. The late Professor
Newton, an eminent ornithologist, has asserted that,
at this period, many systematic zoologists and botanists
had begun to feel great 'searchings of heart' as to
the possibility of maintaining what were the generally
prevalent views concerning the reality and immutability
of species. Huxley, however, declared that he
and many contemporary biologists were ready to say
'to Mosaists and Evolutionists a plague to both your
houses!' and were disposed to turn aside from an
interminable and fruitless discussion, to labour in the
fields of ascertainable fact<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>DARWIN AND WALLACE: THE THEORY OF
NATURAL SELECTION</h3>


<p>Charles Darwin was the grandson of Erasmus
Darwin, who, as we have seen, arrived independently
at conclusions concerning the origin of species very
similar to those of Lamarck, and embodied his views
in poems, which, at the time of their publication,
achieved a considerable popularity. In the younger
philosopher, however, imagination was always kept in
subjection by a determination to '<i>prove</i> all things'
and 'to hold fast that which is good'; though, in
other respects, there were not wanting indications
of the existence of hereditary characteristics in the
grandson.</p>

<p>Born at Shrewsbury and educated in the public
school of that town, Charles Darwin from the first
exhibited signs of individuality in his ideas and his
tastes. The rigid classical teaching of his school did
not touch him, but, with the aid of his elder brother,
he surreptitiously started a chemical laboratory in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
garden tool-house. From his earliest infancy he was
a collector, first of trifles, like seals and franks, but
later of stones, minerals and beetles.</p>

<p>At the outset, only the desire to possess new
things animated him, then a wish to put names to
them, but, at a very early period, a passion arose for
learning all he could about them. Thus when only
9 or 10 years of age, he had 'a desire of being able
to know something about every pebble in front of
the hall-door,' and at 13 or 14, when he heard the
remark of a local naturalist, 'that the world would
come to an end before anyone would be able to
explain how' a boulder (the 'bell-stone' of local-fame)
came to be brought from distant hills&mdash;the lad had such
a deep impression made on his mind, that he says in
after life, 'I <i>meditated</i> over this wonderful stone<a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.'</p>

<p>At the age of 16, he was sent to Edinburgh
University to prepare himself for the work of a
doctor&mdash;the profession of his father and grandfather.
But here his independence of character again asserted
itself. He found most of the lectures 'intolerably
dull,' so he occupied himself with other pursuits,
making many friendships among the younger
naturalists and doing a little in the way of biological
research himself.</p>

<p>That he was not altogether destitute of ambition
in the eyes of his companions, however, is, I think,
indicated by an amusing circumstance. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
library of Charles Darwin, which is carefully preserved
at Cambridge, there is a copy of Jameson's
<i>Manual of Mineralogy</i>, published in 1821, which
was evidently used by the young student in his classwork
at Edinburgh. In this a quizzical fellow-student
has written 'Charles Darwin Esq., M.D., F.R.S.'&mdash;mischievously
adding 'A.S.S.'! Even for geology,
the science to which in all his after life he became so
deeply devoted, young Darwin conceived the most
violent aversion; and as he listened to Jameson's
Wernerian outpourings at Salisbury Crags, he
'determined never to attend to geology,' registering
the terrible vow 'never as long as I lived to read a
book on Geology, or in any way to study the science<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.'</p>

<p>As it became evident that Charles Darwin would
never make a doctor, his father, after two years' trial,
sent him to Cambridge with the object of his
qualifying for a clergyman. But at Christ's College,
in that University, he again took his own line&mdash;which
was not that of divinity&mdash;riding, shooting and beetle-hunting
being his chief delights. Nevertheless, at
Cambridge as at Edinburgh, he seems to have shown
an appreciation for good and instructive society, and
in Henslow, the judicious and amiable Professor of
Botany, the young fellow found such sympathy and
kindly help that he came to be distinguished as 'the
man who walks with Henslow<a name="FNanchor_97_98" id="FNanchor_97_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_98" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.'</p>

<p>After achieving a 'pass degree,' Darwin went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
back to the University for an extra term, and by the
advice of Henslow began to 'think about' the
despised Science of Geology. He was introduced to
that inspiring teacher, Sedgwick, with whom he
made a geological excursion into Wales; but though
he said he 'worked like a tiger' at geology, yet he,
when he got the chance of shooting on his uncle's
estate, had to make the confession, 'I should have
thought myself mad to give up the first days of
partridge-shooting for geology or any other science<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.'</p>

<p>There is a sentence in one of the letters written
at this time which suggests that, even at this early
period in his geological career, Darwin had begun to
experience some misgivings concerning the catastrophic
doctrines of his teachers and contemporaries.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses, but they are
such powerful ones that I suppose, if they were put into action
but for one day, the world would come to an end<a name="FNanchor_99_100" id="FNanchor_99_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_100" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Was he not poking fun at other hypotheses
besides his own?</p>

<p>Darwin's real scientific education began when,
after some hesitation on his father's part, he was
allowed to accept the invitation, made to him through
his friend Henslow, to accompany, at his own expense,
the surveying ship <i>Beagle</i> in a cruise to South
America and afterwards round the world. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
narrow quarters of the little 'ten-gun brig,' he
learned methodical habits and how best to economise
space and time; during his long expeditions on
shore, rendered possible by the work of a surveying
vessel, he had ample opportunities for observing and
collecting; and, above all, the absence of the
distractions from quiet meditation, afforded by a
long sea-voyage, proved in his case invaluable.
Very diligently did he work, accumulating a vast
mass of notes, with catalogues of the specimens he
sent home from time to time to Henslow. He had
received no careful biological training, and Huxley
considered that the voluminous notes he made on
zoological subjects were almost useless<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Very
different was the case, however, with his geological
notes. He had learned to use the blowpipe, and
simple microscope, as well as his hammer and
clinometer; and the notes which he made concerning
his specimens, before packing them up for Cambridge,
were at the same time full, accurate and suggestive.</p>

<p>Darwin has recorded in his autobiography the
wonderful effect produced on his mind by the reading
of the first volume of Lyell's <i>Principles</i>&mdash;an effect
very different from that anticipated by Henslow<a name="FNanchor_101_102" id="FNanchor_101_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_102" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.
From that moment he became the most enthusiastic
of geologists, and never fails in his letters to insist on
his preference for geology over all other branches of
science. Again and again we find him recording<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
observations that he thinks will 'interest Mr Lyell'
and he says in another letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I am become a zealous disciple of Mr Lyell's views, as
known in his admirable book. Geologising in South America,
I am tempted to carry parts to a greater extent even than he
does<a name="FNanchor_102_103" id="FNanchor_102_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_103" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Before reaching home after his voyage, the
duration of which was fortunately extended from two
to five years, he had sent home letters asking to be
elected a fellow of the Geological Society; and,
immediately on his arrival, he gave up his zoological
specimens to others and devoted his main energies
for ten years to the working up of his geological
notes and specimens.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that the grandson of Erasmus
Darwin should in early life have felt little or no
interest in the question of the 'Origin of Species,' but
such was certainly the case. He tells us in his
autobiography that he had read his grandfather's
<i>Zoonomia</i> in his youth, without its producing any
effect on him, and when at Edinburgh he says he
heard his friend Robert Grant (afterwards Professor
of Zoology in University College, London) as they
were walking together 'burst forth in high admiration
of Lamarck and his views on Evolution'&mdash;yet
Darwin adds 'I listened in silent astonishment, and
as far as I can judge without any effect on my
mind<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason of this indifference towards his
grandfather's works is obvious. All through his life,
Darwin, like Lyell, showed a positive distaste for all
speculation or theorising that was not based on a
good foundation of facts or observations. In this
respect, the attitude of Darwin's mind was the very
opposite of that of Herbert Spencer&mdash;who, Huxley
jokingly said, would regard as a 'tragedy'&mdash;'the
killing of a beautiful theory by an ugly fact.'
Darwin tells us himself that, while on his first
reading of <i>Zoonomia</i> he 'greatly admired' it&mdash;evidently
on literary grounds&mdash;yet 'on reading it a
second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years,
I was much disappointed; <i>the proportion of speculation
being so large to the facts given</i>.' Huxley who
knew Charles Darwin so well in later years said of
him that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'He abhors mere speculation as nature abhors a vacuum. He
is as greedy of cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer,
and all the principles he lays down are capable of being brought
to the test of observation and experiment<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>What then, we may ask, were the facts and
observations which turned Darwin's mind towards
the great problem that came to be the work of his
after life? I think it is possible from the study of
his letters and other published writings to give an
answer to this very interesting question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>In November 1832, Darwin returned to Monte
Video, from a long journey in the interior of the
South American Continent, bringing with him many
zoological specimens and a great quantity of fossil
bones, teeth and scales, dug out by him with infinite
toil from the red mud of the Pampas&mdash;these fossils
evidently belonging to the geological period that
immediately preceded that of the existing creation.
The living animals represented in his collection were
all obviously very distinct from those of Europe&mdash;consisting
of curious sloths, anteaters, and armadilloes&mdash;the
so-called 'Edentata' of naturalists.
And when young Darwin came to examine and
compare his <i>fossil</i> bones, teeth and scales he found
that they too must have belonged to animals
(megatherium, mylodon, glyptodon, etc.) quite distinct
from but of strikingly similar structure to those
now living in South America. What could be the
meaning of this wonderful analogy? If Cuvier and
his fellow Catastrophists were correct in their view
that, at each 'revolution' taking place on the earth's
surface, the whole batch of plants and animals was
swept out of existence, and the world was restocked
with a 'new creation,' why should the brand-new
forms, at any particular locality, have such a 'ghost-like'
resemblance to those that had gone before? It
is interesting to note that, just at the same time,
a similar discovery was made with respect to Australia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
In caves in that country, a number of bones were
found which, though evidently belonging to 'extinct'
animals, yet must have belonged to forms resembling
the kangaroos and other 'pouched animals' (marsupials)
now so distinctive of that continent. But of
this fact Darwin was not aware until after his return
to England in 1836.</p>

<p>Among the objects sent from home, which awaited
Darwin on his return to Monte Video, was the second
volume of Lyell's <i>Principles</i>, then newly published;
this book, while rejecting Lamarckism, was crowded
with facts and observations concerning variation,
hybridism, the struggle for existence, and many other
questions bearing on the great problem of the origin
of species. I think there can be no doubt that from
this time Darwin came to regard the question of
species with an interest he had never felt before.</p>

<p>It is of course not suggested that, at this early
date, Darwin had formed any definite ideas as to the
<i>mode</i> in which new species might possibly arise from
pre-existing ones or even that he had been converted
to a belief in evolution. Indeed in 1877 he wrote
'When I was on board the <i>Beagle</i> I believed in the
permanence of species' yet he adds 'but as far as
I can remember <i>vague doubts</i> occasionally flitted
across my mind.' Such 'vague doubts' could scarcely
have failed to have arisen when, as happened during
all his journeys from north to south of the South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
American Continent, he found the same curious
correspondence between existing and late fossil forms
of life again and again illustrated.</p>

<p>But towards the end of the voyage, an even
stronger element of doubt as to the immutability of
species was awakened in his mind. When he came
to study the forms of life existing in the Galapagos
Islands, off the west coast of South America, he was
startled by the discovery of the following facts.
Each small island had its own 'fauna' or assemblage
of animals&mdash;this being very strikingly shown in the
case of the reptiles and birds. And yet, though the
<i>species</i> were different, there was obviously a very
wonderful 'family likeness' to one another between
the forms in the several islands and between them all
and the animals living in the adjoining portion of the
continent. Surely this could not be accidental, but
must indicate relationships due to descent from
common ancestors!</p>

<p>Charles Darwin returned to England in 1836, and
at once made the acquaintance of Lyell. He says in
one place, 'I saw a great deal of Lyell' and in another
that 'I saw more of Lyell than of any other man,
both before and after my marriage.' In one of his
letters he writes, 'You cannot conceive anything
more thoroughly good natured than the heart-and-soul
manner in which he put himself in my place and
thought what would be best to do<a name="FNanchor_105_106" id="FNanchor_105_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_106" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.' For two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
years Darwin was comparatively free from the
distressing malady which clouded so much of his
after life. And, during that time, he engaged very
heartily with Lyell in those combats at the Geological
Society (of which he had become one of the Secretaries)
in which their joint views concerning the truth
of continuity or evolution in the inorganic world
were defended against the attacks of the militant
catastrophists. Darwin, however, did not act on the
defensive alone, but brought forward a number of
papers strongly supporting his new friend's views.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that, while thus engaged,
and in constant friendly intercourse with
Lyell, Darwin must have felt&mdash;like other earnest
thinkers on geology at that day&mdash;that the principles
they were advocating of 'continuity' in the inorganic
world must be equally applicable to the organic
world&mdash;and thus that the question of evolution
would acquire a new interest for him.</p>

<p>But it was undoubtedly the revision of the notes
made on board the <i>Beagle</i>, and the study of the
specimens which had been sent home by him from
time to time, that produced the great determining
influence on Darwin's career. All through the
voyage he had endeavoured, with as much literary
skill as he could command, to record with accuracy
the observations he made, and the conclusions to
which, on careful reflection, they seemed to point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
And on his return to England, these patiently written
journals were revised and prepared for publication
forming that charming work <i>A Naturalist's Voyage.
Journal of Researches into the Natural History and
Geology of the Countries visited during the Voyage
of H.M.S. 'Beagle' round the world.</i></p>

<p>As Darwin, with the specimens before him, revised
his notes, and reconsidered the impressions made on
his mind, the 'vague doubts' he had entertained,
from time to time, concerning the immutability of
species, would come back to him with new force and
cumulative effect. 'I then saw,' he says, 'how many facts
indicated the common descent of species,' and further,
'It occurred to me in 1837, that something might
perhaps be made out on this question by patiently
accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts
which could possibly have any bearing on it.' In
July of that year, he opened his first note-book on
the subject<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>&mdash;the note-books being soon replaced by
a series of portfolios, in which extracts from the
various works he read, facts obtained by correspondence,
the records of experiments and observation,
and ideas suggested by constant meditation were
slowly accumulated for twenty years. Mr Francis
Darwin has published a series of extracts from the
note-book of 1837, which amply prove that by this
time Charles Darwin had become 'a convinced
evolutionist<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifteen months after this 'systematic enquiry'
began, Darwin happened to read the celebrated work
of Malthus <i>On Population</i>, for amusement, and this
served as a spark falling on a long prepared train
of thought. The idea that as animals and plants
multiply in geometrical progression, while the
supplies of food and space to be occupied remain
nearly constant, and that this must lead to a 'struggle
for existence' of the most desperate kind, was by no
means new to Darwin, for the elder De Candolle,
Lyell and others had enlarged upon it; yet the facts
with regard to the human race, so strikingly presented
by Malthus, brought the whole question with
such vividness before him that the idea of 'Natural
Selection' flashed upon Darwin's mind. This hypothesis
cannot be better or more succinctly stated
than in Huxley's words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'All <i>species</i> have been produced by the development of
<i>varieties</i> from common stocks: by the conversion of these, first
into <i>permanent races</i> and then into <i>new species</i>, by the process
of <i>natural selection</i>, which process is essentially identical with
that artificial selection by which man has originated the races of
domestic animals&mdash;the <i>struggle for existence</i> taking the place of
man, and exerting, in the case of natural selection, that selective
action which he performs in artificial selection<a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>With characteristic caution, Darwin determined
not to write down 'even the briefest sketch' of this
hypothesis, that had so suddenly presented itself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
his mind. His habit of thought was always to give
the fullest consideration and weight to any possible
objection that presented itself to his own mind or
could be suggested to him by others. Though he was
satisfied as to the truth and importance of the principle
of natural selection, there is evidence that for some
years he was oppressed by difficulties, which I think
would have seemed greater to him than to anyone
else. In my conversations with Darwin, in after
years, it always struck me that he attached an
exaggerated importance to the merest suggestion of
a view opposed to that he was himself inclined to
adopt; indeed I sometimes almost feared to indicate
a <i>possible</i> different point of view to his own, for fear
of receiving such an answer as 'What a very striking
objection, how stupid of me not to see it before, I
must really reconsider the whole subject.'</p>

<p>While a divinity student at Cambridge, Darwin
had been much struck with the logical form of the
works both of Euclid and of Paley. The rooms of
the latter he seems to have actually occupied at
Christ's College and the works of the great divine
were so diligently studied that their deep influence
remained with him in after life<a name="FNanchor_109_110" id="FNanchor_109_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_110" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>I think it must have been the remembrance of
the arguments of Paley on the 'proofs of design' in
Nature, that seem in after life to have haunted
Darwin so that for long he failed to recognise fully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that the principle of natural selection accounted not
only for the <i>adaptation</i> of an organism to its environment,
but at the same time explains that <i>divergence</i>,
which must have taken place in species in order to
give rise to their wonderfully varied characters.</p>

<p>It was not till long after he came to Down in
1842, he tells us in his autobiography, that his mind
freed itself from this objection. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my
carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me,'</p></div>

<p>and he compares the relief to his mind as resembling
the effect produced by 'Columbus and his egg<a name="FNanchor_110_111" id="FNanchor_110_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_111" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.'
Some may think the 'solution' of Columbus was
itself not a very satisfactory one; and I am inclined
to regard the difficulties of which Darwin records so
sudden and dramatic a removal as more imaginary
than real!</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, as pointed out by the
late Professor Alfred Newton<a name="FNanchor_111_112" id="FNanchor_111_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_112" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, there was among
naturalists during the second quarter of the nineteenth
century a feeling of dissatisfaction with
respect to current ideas concerning the origin of
species, accompanied in many cases with one of
expectation that a solution might soon be found.
Others, however, despairingly regarded it as 'the
mystery of mysteries' for which it was hopeless to
attempt to find a key. There was, however, one
man, who simultaneously with Darwin was meditating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
earnestly on the problem and who eventually reached
the same goal.</p>

<p>Alfred Russel Wallace was born thirteen years
after Darwin, and a quarter of a century after Lyell.
He did not possess the moderate income that permits
of entire devotion to scientific research&mdash;an advantage,
the importance of which in their own cases,
both Lyell and Darwin were always so ready to
acknowledge. Wallace, after working for a time as a
land-surveyor and then as a teacher, at the age of 26
set off with another naturalist, H. W. Bates, on a
collecting tour in South America&mdash;hoping by the sale
of specimens to cover the expenses of travel. Like
Lyell and Darwin, he was an enthusiastic entomologist,
and had conceived the same passion for travel. He
had, as we have already seen, been deeply impressed
by reading the <i>Principles of Geology</i>, and after
spending four years in South America undertook a
second collecting tour, which lasted twice that time,
in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/ill_123.jpg" width="391" height="590" alt="Alfred R. Wallace" title="" />
</div>

<p>Before leaving England in 1848, Wallace had
read and been impressed by reading the <i>Vestiges of
Creation</i>, and there can be no doubt that from that
period the question of evolution was always more or
less distinctly present in his mind. While in Sarawak
in the wet season, he tells us, 'I was quite alone with
one Malay boy as cook, and during the evenings and
wet days I had nothing to do but to look over my
books and ponder over the problem which was rarely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
absent from my thoughts.' He goes on to say that
by 'combining the ideas he had derived from his
books that treated of the distribution of plants and
animals with those he obtained from the great work
of Lyell' he thought 'some valuable conclusions
might be reached<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.' Thus originated the very
remarkable paper, <i>On the Law which has regulated
the Introduction of New Species</i>, the main conclusion
of which was as follows: 'Every species has come into
existence coincident both in space and time with a
pre-existing closely allied species.' As Wallace has
himself said, 'This clearly pointed to some kind of
evolution ... but the <i>how</i> was still a secret.'</p>

<p>This essay was published in the <i>Annals and
Magazine of Natural History</i> in September 1855. It
attracted much attention from Lyell and Darwin and
later from Huxley. One important result of it was
that Darwin and Wallace entered into friendly
correspondence. But although Darwin in his letters
to Wallace informed him that he had been engaged
for a long time in collecting facts which bore on the
question of the origin of species, he gave no hint of
the theory of natural selection he had conceived
seventeen years before&mdash;indeed his friends Lyell and
Hooker appear at that time to have been the only
persons, outside his family circle, whom he had taken
into his confidence.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1858, Wallace was at Ternate in
the island of Celebes, where he lay sick with fever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and as his thoughts wandered to the ever-present
problem of species, there suddenly recurred to his
memory the writings of Malthus, which he had read
twelve years before. Then and there, 'in a sudden
flash of insight' the idea of natural selection presented
itself to his mind, and after a few hours'
thought the chief points were written down, and
within a week the matter was 'copied on thin letter-paper'
and sent to Darwin by the next post, with a
letter to the following effect<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. Wallace stated that
the idea seemed new to himself and he asked Darwin,
if he also thought it new, to show it to Lyell, who
had taken so much interest in his former paper.
Little did Wallace think, in the absence of all
knowledge on his part of Darwin's own conclusions,
what stir would be made by his paper when it arrived
in England!</p>

<p>Wallace's essay was entitled <i>On the Tendency of
Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original
Type</i>, and it is a singularly lucid and striking
presentment, in small compass, of the theory of
Natural Selection.</p>

<p>Had these two men been of less noble and
generous nature, the history of science might have
been dishonoured by a painful discussion on a
question of priority. Fortunately we are not called
upon for anything like a judicial investigation of
rival claims; for Darwin as soon as he read the essay
saw that&mdash;as Lyell had often warned him might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the case&mdash;he was completely forestalled in the
publication of his theory. The letter and paper
arrived at a sad time for Darwin&mdash;he was at the
moment very ill, there was 'scarlet fever raging in
his family, to which an infant son had succumbed
on the previous day, and a daughter was ill with
diphtheria<a name="FNanchor_114_115" id="FNanchor_114_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_115" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.' Darwin at once wrote hurriedly to
Lyell enclosing the essay and saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace had my
MS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better
short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my
chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say he
wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and
offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, whatever it
may amount to, will be smashed, though my book, if it ever have
any value, will not be deteriorated, as all the labour consists in
the application of the theory. I hope you will approve of
Wallace's sketch, that I may tell him what to say<a name="FNanchor_115_116" id="FNanchor_115_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_116" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>And Wallace&mdash;what was the line taken by him in
the unfortunate complication that had thus arisen?
From the very first his action was all that is generous
and noble. Not only did he, from the first, entirely
acquiesce in the course taken by Lyell and Hooker,
but, writing in 1870, when the fame of Darwin's work
had reached its full height, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I have felt all my life and I still feel, the most sincere
satisfaction that Mr Darwin had been at work long before me,
and that it was not left for me to attempt to write <i>The Origin of
Species</i>. I have long since measured my own strength and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
know well that it would be quite unequal to that task. For
abler men than myself may confess, that they have not that
untiring patience in accumulating, and that wonderful skill in
using, large masses of facts of the most varied kind,&mdash;that wide
and accurate physiological knowledge,&mdash;that acuteness in devising
and skill in carrying out experiments,&mdash;and that admirable style
of composition, at once clear, persuasive and judicial,&mdash;qualities
which in their harmonious combination mark out Mr Darwin as
the man, perhaps of all men now living, best fitted for the great
work he has undertaken and accomplished<a name="FNanchor_116_117" id="FNanchor_116_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_117" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>And fifty years after the joint publication of the
theory of Natural Selection to the Linnean Society
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>I</i> was then (as often since) the "young man in a hurry," <i>he</i>'
(Darwin) 'the painstaking and patient student, seeking ever the
full demonstration of the truth he had discovered, rather than to
achieve immediate personal fame<a name="FNanchor_117_118" id="FNanchor_117_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_118" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>And when he referred to the respective shares of
Darwin and himself to the credit of having brought
forward the theory of natural selection, he actually
suggests as a fair proportion '<i>twenty years to one
week</i>'&mdash;those being the periods each had devoted to
the subject<a name="FNanchor_118_119" id="FNanchor_118_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_119" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>!</p>

<p>Never surely was such a noble example of
personal abnegation! We admire the generosity,
though we cannot accept the estimate, for do we not
know that, for at least half the period of Darwin's
patient quest, Wallace had spent in deeply pondering
upon the same great question?</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES</h3>


<p>In the preceding chapter I have endeavoured to
show how the hypothesis of Natural Selection
originated in the minds of its authors, and must
now invite attention to the way in which it was
introduced to the world. What has been said earlier
with respect to the labours and writings of Hutton,
Scrope and Lyell may serve to indicate the great
importance of the <i>manner</i> of presentment of new
ideas&mdash;the logical force and literary skill with which
they are brought to the notice of scientific contemporaries
and the world at large.</p>

<p>There are some striking passages in Darwin's
naive 'autobiography and letters' which indicate the
beginnings of his ambition for literary distinction.
It must always be borne in mind in reading this
autobiography, however, that it was not intended by
Darwin for publication, but only for the amusement
of the members of his own family. But the charming
and unsophisticated self-revelations in it will always
be a source of delight to the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>When making his first original observations among
the volcanic cones and craters of St Jago in the
Cape-de-Verde Islands, he says 'It then first dawned
on me that I might perhaps write a book on the
geology of the different countries visited, and this
made me thrill with delight<a name="FNanchor_119_120" id="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.' He tells us concerning
his regular occupations on board the <i>Beagle</i>, that
'during some part of the day, I wrote my Journal
and took much pains in describing carefully and
vividly all that I had seen: and this was good
practice<a name="FNanchor_120_121" id="FNanchor_120_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_121" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.'</p>

<p>'Later in the voyage' he says 'FitzRoy' (the
Captain of the <i>Beagle</i>) 'asked me to read some of my
Journal and declared it would be worth publishing,
so here was a second book in prospect<a name="FNanchor_121_122" id="FNanchor_121_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_122" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>!'</p>

<p>Darwin's first published writings were the extracts
from his letters which Henslow read to the Philosophical
Society of Cambridge, and those which
Sedgwick submitted to the Geological Society. At
Ascension, on the voyage home, a letter from
Darwin's sisters had informed him of the commendation
with which Sedgwick had spoken to his
father of these papers, and he wrote fifty years
afterwards: 'After reading this letter, I clambered
over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding
step, and made the volcanic rocks ring under my
geological hammer.' When in 1839 his charming
<i>Journal of Researches</i> was published he records that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
'The success of this my first literary child always
tickles my vanity more than that of any of my other
books<a name="FNanchor_122_123" id="FNanchor_122_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_123" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.'</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no one could possibly be
more diffident and modest about his actual literary
performances than was Charles Darwin. I have heard
him again and again express a wish that he possessed
'dear old Lyell's literary skill'; and he often spoke
with the greatest enthusiasm of the 'clearness and
force of Huxley's style.' On one occasion he mentioned
to me, with something like sadness in his
voice, that it had been asserted 'there was a want of
connection and continuity in the written arguments,'
and he told me that, while engaged on the <i>Origin</i>,
he had seldom been able to write, without interruption
from pain, for more than twenty minutes at
a time!</p>

<p>Charles Darwin never spoke definitely to me
about the nature of the sufferings that he so
patiently endured. On the occasion of my first visit
to him at Down he wrote me a letter (dated
August 25th, 1880) in which, after giving the most
minute and kindly directions concerning the journey,
he arranged that his dog-cart should bring me to the
house in time for a 1 o'clock lunch, telling me that to
catch a certain train for return, it would be necessary
to leave his house a little before 4 o'clock. But he
added significantly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'But I am bound to tell you that I shall not be able to talk
with you or anyone else for this length of time, however much I
should like to do so&mdash;but you can read newspaper or take a stroll
during part of the time.'</p></div>

<p>His constant practice, whenever I visited him,
either at Down or at his brother's or daughter's house
in London, was to retire with me, after lunch, to a
room where we could 'talk geology' for about three
quarters of an hour. At the end of that time,
Mrs Darwin would come in smilingly, and though no
word was spoken by her, Darwin would at once rise
and beg me to read the newspaper for a time, or, if I
preferred it, to take a stroll in the garden; and after
urging me to stay 'if I could possibly spare the time,'
would go away, as I understood to lie down. On his
return, about half an hour later, the discussion would
be resumed where it had been left off, without further
remark.</p>

<p>Mr Francis Darwin has told us that the nature
and extent of his father's sufferings&mdash;so patiently
and uncomplainingly borne&mdash;were never fully known,
even to his own children, but only to the faithful
wife who devoted her whole life to the care
of his health. As is well known, Darwin seldom
visited at other houses, besides those of immediate
relatives, or the hydropathic establishment at which
he sought relief from his illness. But he was in the
habit of sometimes, when in London, calling upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
David Forbes the mineralogist (a younger brother of
Edward Forbes) then living in York Street, Portman
Square. The bonds of union between Charles Darwin
and David Forbes were, first, that they had both
travelled extensively in South America, and secondly,
that both were greatly interested in methods of
preserving and making available for future reference
all notes and memoranda collected from various
sources. David Forbes devoted to the purpose a
large room with the most elaborate system of pigeon-holes,
about which he told me that Darwin was
greatly excited. He also mentioned to me that, on
one or more occasions, while Darwin was in his
house, pains of such a violent character had seized
him that he had been compelled to lie down for a time
and had occasioned his host the greatest alarm.</p>

<p>It must always therefore be remembered, in
reading Darwin's works, what were the sad conditions
under which they were produced. It seems to be
doubtful to what extent his ill-health may be
regarded as the result of an almost fatal malady,
from which he suffered in South America, or as the
effect of the constant and prolonged sea-sickness of
which he was the victim during the five years' voyage.
But certain it is that his work was carried on under
no ordinary difficulties, and that it was only by the
exercise of the sternest resolution, in devoting every
moment of time that he was free from pain to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
tasks, that he was able to accomplish his great
undertakings.</p>

<p>I do not think, however, that any unprejudiced
reader will regard Darwin's literary work as standing
in need of anything like an apology. He always
aims&mdash;and I think succeeds&mdash;at conveying his meaning
in simple and direct language; and in all his works
there is manifest that undercurrent of quiet enthusiasm,
which was so strikingly displayed in his
conversation. It was delightful to witness the keen
enjoyment with which he heard of any new fact or
observation bearing on the pursuits in which he was
engaged, and his generous nature always led him to
attach an exaggerated value to any discovery or
suggestion which might be brought to his knowledge&mdash;and
to appraise the work of others above his own.</p>

<p>The most striking proof of the excellence and
value of Darwin's literary work is the fact that his
numerous books have attained a circulation, in their
original form, probably surpassing that of any other
scientific writings ever produced&mdash;and that, in translations,
they have appealed to a wider circle of
readers than any previous naturalist has ever
addressed!</p>

<p>We have seen that the idea of Natural Selection
'flashed on' Darwin's mind in October 1838, and
although he was himself inclined to think that his
<i>complete</i> satisfaction with it, as a solution of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
problem of the origin of species, was delayed to a
considerably later date, yet I believe that this was
only the result of his over-cautious temperament,
and we must accept the date named as being that of
the real birth of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>At this early date, too, it is evident that Darwin
conceived the idea that he might accomplish for the
principle of evolution in the organic world, what
Lyell had done, in the <i>Principles</i>, for the inorganic
world. To cite his own words, 'after my return to
England it appeared to me that by following the
example of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all
facts which bore in any way on the variation of
animals and plants under domestication and nature,
some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole
subject<a name="FNanchor_123_124" id="FNanchor_123_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_124" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.' 'In June 1842,' he says, 'I first <i>allowed</i>
myself' (how significant is the phrase!) 'the satisfaction
of writing a brief abstract of my theory in
pencil in 35 pages<a name="FNanchor_124_125" id="FNanchor_124_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_125" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.'</p>

<p>For many years it was thought that this first
sketch of Darwin's great work had been lost. But
after the death of Mrs Darwin in 1896, when the
house at Down was vacated, the interesting MS. was
found 'hidden in a cupboard under the stairs which
was not used for papers of any value but rather as
an overflow of matters he did not wish to destroy<a name="FNanchor_125_126" id="FNanchor_125_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_126" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.'
By the pious care of his son, this interesting MS.&mdash;hurriedly
written and sometimes almost illegible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>&mdash;has
been given to the world, and it proves how
completely Darwin had, at that early date, thought
out the main lines of his future <i>opus magnum</i>.</p>

<p>Darwin, however, had no idea of publishing his
theory to the world until he was able to support it
by a great mass of facts and observations. Lyell,
again and again, warned him of the danger which
he incurred of being forestalled by other workers;
while his brother Erasmus constantly said to him,
'You will find that some one will have been before
you<a name="FNanchor_126_127" id="FNanchor_126_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_127" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>!'</p>

<p>The utmost that Darwin could be persuaded to
do, however, was to enlarge his sketch of 1842 into
one of 230 pages. This he did in the summer of
1844. His manner of procedure seems to have been
that, keeping to the same general arrangement of
the matter as he had adopted in his original sketch,
he elaborated the arguments and added illustrations.
Each of the 35 pages of the pencilled sketch, as it
was dealt with, had a vertical line drawn across it
and was thrown aside. While the 'pencilled sketch'
of 1842 was little better than a collection of memoranda,
which, though intelligible to the writer at the
time, are sometimes difficult either to decipher or
to understand the meaning of, the expanded work
of 1844 was a much more connected and readable
document, which Darwin caused to be carefully
copied out. The work was done in the summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
months, while he was absent from home, and unable
therefore to refer to his abundant notes&mdash;Darwin
speaks of it, therefore, as 'done from memory.'</p>

<p>The two sketches, as Mr Francis Darwin points
out, were each divided into two distinct parts, though
this arrangement is not adopted in the <i>Origin of
Species</i>, as finally published. Charles Darwin on many
occasions spoke of having adopted the <i>Principles of
Geology</i> as his model. That work as we have seen
consisted of a first portion (eventually expanded from
one to two volumes), in which the general principles
were enunciated and illustrated, and a second portion
(forming the third volume), in which those principles
were applied to deciphering the history of the globe
in the past. I think that Darwin's original intention
was to follow a similar plan; the first part of his
work dealing with the evidences derived from the
study of variation, crossing, the struggle for existence,
etc., and the second to the proofs that natural
selection had really operated as illustrated by the
geological record, by the facts of geographical distribution,
and by many curious phenomena exhibited
by plants and animals. Although this plan was
eventually abandoned&mdash;no doubt wisely&mdash;when the
<i>Origin</i> came to be written, we cannot but recognise
in it another illustration of the great influence
exercised by Lyell and his works on Darwin&mdash;an influence
the latter was always so ready to acknowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 5th July 1844, Darwin wrote a letter to
his wife in which he said, 'I have just finished my
sketch of my species theory. If, as I believe, my
theory in time be accepted, even by one competent
judge, it will be a considerable step in science.' He
goes on to request his wife, 'in case of my sudden
death' to devote &pound;400 (or if found necessary &pound;500)
to securing an editor and publishing the work. As
editor he says 'Lyell would be the best, if he would
undertake it,' and later, 'Lyell, especially with the aid
of Hooker (and if any good zoological aid), would be
best of all.' He then suggests other names from
which a choice might be made, but adds 'the editor
must be a geologist as well as naturalist.' Fortunately
for the world Mrs Darwin was never called upon to
take action in accordance with the terms of this
affecting document<a name="FNanchor_127_128" id="FNanchor_127_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_128" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that, at this time, Darwin
was hard at work on the three volumes of the
<i>Geology of the Beagle</i>, and on the second and revised
edition of his <i>Journal of Researches</i>. This which he
considered his 'proper work' he stuck to closely,
whenever his health permitted. He had hoped to
complete these books in three or four years, but
they actually occupied him for <i>ten</i>, owing to constant
interruptions from illness. His occasional neglect of
this task, and indulgence in his 'species work,' as he
called it, was always spoken of at this time by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Darwin as 'idleness.' And when the geological and
narrative books were finished, Darwin took up the
systematic study of the Barnacles (<i>Cirripedia</i>), both
recent and fossil, and wrote two monumental works
on the subject. These occupied eight years, two out
of which he estimated were lost by interruptions
from illness. So absorbed was he in this work, that
his children regarded it as the <i>necessary occupation</i>
of a man,&mdash;and when a visitor in the house was seen
not to be so employed one of them enquired of their
mother, 'When does Mr &mdash;&mdash; do <i>his</i> Barnacles?'
Huxley has left on record his view that in devoting
so long a time to the study of the Barnacles Darwin
'never did a wiser thing,' for it brought him into
direct contact with the principles on which naturalists
found 'species<a name="FNanchor_128_129" id="FNanchor_128_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_129" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.' And Hooker has expressed the
same opinion.</p>

<p>Daring these years of labour in geology and
zoology&mdash;interrupted only by the 'hours of idleness'&mdash;devoted
to 'the species question,' Darwin, though
leading at Down almost the life of a hermit, was
nevertheless in frequent communication with two or
three faithful friends who followed his labours with
the deepest interest. Cautious as was Darwin himself,
he found in his life-long friend Lyell, a still more
doubting and critical spirit, and it is clear from what
Darwin says that he derived much help by laying
new ideas and suggestions before him. The year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
before Darwin's death he wrote of Lyell, 'When I
made a remark to him on Geology, he never rested
till he saw the whole case clearly, and often made me
see it more clearly than I had done before.'</p>

<p>Lyell's father was a botanist of considerable
repute, the friend of Sir William Hooker and his
distinguished son Dr (now Sir Joseph) Hooker.
While Darwin was writing his <i>Journal of Researches</i>,
he handed the proof-sheets to Lyell with permission
to show them to his father, who was a man of great
literary judgment. The elder Lyell, in turn, showed
them to young Mr Hooker, who was then preparing
to join Sir James Ross, in his celebrated Antarctic
voyage with H.M. ships <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>. Hooker
was then working hard to take his doctor's degree
before joining the expedition as surgeon, but he kept
Darwin's proof-sheets under his pillow, so as to get
opportunities of reading them 'between waking and
rising.' Before leaving England, however, Hooker in
1839 casually met and was introduced to Darwin, and
thus commenced a friendship which resulted in such
inestimable benefits to science. Before sailing with
the Antarctic expedition the young surgeon received
from Charles Lyell, as a parting gift, 'a copy of
Darwin's <i>Journal</i> complete'; and he tells us that
the perusal stimulated in him 'an enthusiasm in the
desire to travel and observe<a name="FNanchor_129_130" id="FNanchor_129_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_130" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.'</p>

<p>On Hooker's return from the voyage in 1843,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a friendly letter from Darwin commenced that remarkable
correspondence, which will always afford
the best means of judging of the development of
ideas in Darwin's mind. Hooker's wide knowledge
of plants&mdash;especially of all questions concerning
their distribution&mdash;was of invaluable assistance to
Darwin, at a time when his attention was more
particularly absorbed by geology and zoology, while
botany had not as yet received much attention from
him. Hooker's experience, gained in travel, his
sound judgment and balanced mind made him a
judicious adviser, while his caution and candour
fitted him to become a trenchant critic of new suggestions,
scarcely inferior in that respect to Lyell.</p>

<p>Darwin does not appear to have made the
acquaintance of Huxley till a considerably later date;
but we find the great comparative anatomist had in
1851 already become so deeply impressed by Darwin,
that he said in writing to a friend he 'might be
anything if he had good health<a name="FNanchor_130_131" id="FNanchor_130_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_131" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.' Huxley used to
visit Darwin at Down occasionally, and I have often
heard the latter speak of the instruction and pleasure
he enjoyed from their intercourse.</p>

<p>For many years of his life, Darwin used to come
to London and stay with his brother or daughter for
about a week at a time, and on these occasions&mdash;which
usually occurred about twice in the year I
believe&mdash;he would meet Lyell to 'talk Geology,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Hooker for discussions on Botany, and Huxley for
Zoology.</p>

<p>For twenty years Darwin had 'collected facts on
a wholesale scale, more especially with respect to
domesticated productions, by printed enquiries, by
conversations with skilful breeders and gardeners,
and by extensive reading.' 'When,' he added, 'I see
the list of books of all kinds which I read and
abstracted, including whole series of Journals and
Transactions, I am surprised at my industry<a name="FNanchor_131_132" id="FNanchor_131_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_132" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.' In
September 1854 the Barnacle work was finished and
10,000 specimens sent out of the house and distributed,
and then he devoted himself to arranging his 'huge
pile of notes, to observing and experimenting in
relation to the transmutation of species.'</p>

<p>It was early in 1856 when this work had been
completed, that, again urged by Lyell, he actually
commenced writing his book. It was planned as a
work on a considerable scale and, if finished, would
have reached dimensions three or four times as
great as did eventually the <i>Origin of Species</i>.
Working steadily and continuously he had got as far
as Chapter X, completing more than one half the
book, when as he says Wallace's letter and essay came
'like a bolt from the blue.'</p>

<p>Oppressed by illness, anxiety and perplexity, as
we have seen that Darwin was at the time, he
fortunately consented to leave matters&mdash;though with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
great reluctance&mdash;in the hands of his friends Lyell
and Hooker. They took the wise course of reading
Wallace's paper at the Linnean Society on July 1st,
1858, at the same time giving extracts from Darwin's
memoir written in 1844, and the abstract of a letter
written by Darwin in 1857 to the distinguished
American botanist, Asa Gray. This solution of the
difficulty happily met with the complete approval of
Wallace; and, as the result of the episode, Darwin
came to the conclusion that it would not be wise to
defer full publication of his views, until the extensive
work on which he was engaged could be finished, but
an 'abstract' of them must be prepared and issued
with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>For a time there was hesitation, as Darwin's
correspondence with Lyell and Hooker shows, between
the two plans of sending this 'abstract' to the
Linnean Society in a series of papers or of making
it an independent book. But Darwin entertained an
invincible dislike to submitting his various conclusions
to the judgment of the Council of a Society, and, in
the end, the preparation of the 'Abstract' in the
form of a book of moderate size, was decided on.
This was the origin of Darwin's great work.</p>

<p>The sickness at Down had led to the abandonment
of the house for a time, and, three weeks after the
reading of the joint paper at the Linnean Society,
we find Darwin temporarily established at Sandown,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in the Isle of Wight, where the writing of the <i>Origin
of Species</i> was commenced. The work was resumed
in September when the family returned to Down, and
from that time was pressed forward with the greatest
diligence.</p>

<p>For the first half of the book, the task before
Darwin was to condense, into less than one half their
dimensions, the chapters he had already written for
the large work as originally projected. But for the
second half of the book, he had to expand directly
from the essay of 1844.</p>

<p>So closely did Darwin apply himself to the work,
that, by the end of March 28th, 1859, he was able to
write to Lyell telling him that he hoped to be ready
to go to press early in May, and asking advice about
publication: he says, 'My Abstract will be about five
hundred pages of the size of your first edition of the
<i>Elements of Geology</i>.' Lyell introduced Darwin to
John Murray, who had issued all his own works, and
the present representative of that publishing firm
has placed on record a very interesting account of
the ever thoughtful and considerate relations between
Darwin and his publishers, which were maintained to
the end<a name="FNanchor_132_133" id="FNanchor_132_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_133" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>The MS. of the book seems to have been
practically finished early in May, and Darwin's
health then broke down for a time, so completely
that he had to retire to a hydropathic establishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
By June 21st he was able to write to Lyell 'I am
working very hard, but get on slowly, for I find that
my corrections are terrifically heavy, and the work
most difficult to me. I have corrected 130 pages,
and the volume will be about 500. I have tried my
best to make it clear and striking, but very much
fear that I have failed; so many discussions are and
must be very perplexing. <i>I have done my best.</i> If
you had all my materials, I am sure you would have
made a splendid book. I long to finish, for I am
certainly worn out<a name="FNanchor_133_134" id="FNanchor_133_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_134" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.' On September 10th the last
proof was corrected and the preparation of the
index commenced. At the meeting of the British
Association in Aberdeen, Lyell made the important
announcement of the approaching publication of the
great work. On November 24th the book was issued,
1250 copies having been printed, and Darwin wrote
to Murray, 'I am infinitely pleased and proud at the
appearance of my child.' The edition was sold out
in a day, and was followed early in the next year
by the issue of 3000 copies; and untold thousands
have since appeared.</p>

<p>The writing of such a work as the <i>Origin of
Species</i>, in so short a time&mdash;especially taking into
consideration the condition of its author's health&mdash;was
a most remarkable feat. It would, of course,
not have been possible but for the fact that Darwin's
mind was completely saturated with the subject, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
that he had command of such an enormous body
of methodically arranged notes. He showed the
greatest anxiety to convince his scientific contemporaries,
and at the same time to make his meaning
clear to the general reader. With the former object,
both MS. and printed proofs were submitted to the
criticism of Lyell and Hooker; and the latter end
was obtained by sending the MS. to a lady friend,
Miss G. Tollet&mdash;she, as Darwin says 'being an
excellent judge of style, is going to look out errors
for me.' Finally the proofs of the book were
carefully read by Mrs Darwin herself.</p>

<p>The splendid success achieved by the work is
a matter of history. Its clearness of statement and
candour in reasoning pleased the general public;
critics without any profound knowledge of natural
history were beguiled into the opinion that they
<i>understood</i> the whole matter! and, according to
their varying tastes, indulged in shallow objection
or slightly offensive patronage. The fully-anticipated,
theological vituperation was of course not lacking,
but most of the 'replies' to Darwin's arguments
were 'lifted' from the book itself, in which objections
to his views were honestly stated and candidly considered
by the author.</p>

<p>The best testimony to the profound and far-reaching
character of the scientific discussions of
the <i>Origin of Species</i> is found in the fact that both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Hooker and Huxley, in spite of their wide knowledge
and long intercourse with Darwin, found the work,
so condensed were its reasonings, a 'very hard book'
to read, one on which it was difficult to pronounce
a judgment till after several perusals!</p>

<p>It would be idle to speculate at the present day
whether the cause of Evolution would have been
better served by the publication, as Darwin at one
time proposed, of a 'Preliminary Essay,' like that of
1844, or by the great work, which had been commenced
and half completed in 1858, rather than by
the 'abstract,' in which the theory of Natural Selection
was in the end presented to the world. Probably
the more moderate dimensions of the <i>Origin of
Species</i> made it far better suited for the general
reader; while the condensation which was necessitated
did not in the end militate against its influence with
men of science. It will I think be now generally
conceded that the great success of this grand work
was fully deserved. A subject of such complexity as
that which it dealt with could only be adequately
discussed in a manner that would demand careful
attention and thought on the part of the reader;
and Darwin's well-weighed words, carefully balanced
sentences, and guarded reservations are admirably
adapted to the accomplishment of the difficult task
he had undertaken. The <i>Origin of Species</i> has been
read by the millions with pleasure, and, at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
time, by the deepest thinkers of the age with
conviction.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to refer to the literary style
of Darwin's work without a reference to a misconception
arising from that very candid analysis of his
characteristics which he wrote for the satisfaction of
his family, but which has happily been given to the
world by his son. In his early life Darwin was
exceedingly fond of music, and took such delight in
good literature, especially poetry, that when on his
journeys in South America he found himself able to
carry only one book with him, the work chosen was
the poems of Milton&mdash;the former student of his own
Christ's College, Cambridge. But towards the end
of his life, Darwin had sadly to confess that he found
that he had quite lost the capacity of enjoying either
music or the noblest works of literature.</p>

<p>Some have argued that Darwin's scientific labours
must have actually proved destructive to his artistic
and literary tastes, and have even gone so far as to
assert&mdash;in spite of numerous examples to the contrary&mdash;that
there is a natural antithesis between the
mental conditions that respectively favour scientific
and artistic excellence.</p>

<p>But I think there is a very simple explanation of
the loss by Darwin of his powers of enjoyment of
music and poetry, a loss which he evidently greatly
deplored. His scientific undertaking was so gigantic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and, at the same time, his health was so broken and
precarious, that he felt his only chance of success lay
in utilizing, for the tasks before him, every moment
that he was free from acute suffering and retained
any power of working. Consequently, when the self-imposed
task of each day was completed, he found
himself in a state of mental collapse. Now to
appreciate the beauties of fine music or the work of
a great writer certainly demands that the mind
should be fresh and unjaded, whereas, at the only
times Darwin had for relaxation, he was quite unfitted
for these higher delights. We are not surprised then
to learn that he sought and found relief in listening to
his wife's reading of some pleasant novel or in the
nightly game of backgammon, as the only means of
resting his wearied brain.</p>

<p>No one who had the privilege of conversing with
Darwin in his later years can doubt of his having
retained to the end the full possession of his refined
tastes as well as his great mental powers. His love
for and sympathy with every movement tending to
progress&mdash;especially in the scientific and educational
world&mdash;his devotion to his friends, with no little
indulgence of indignation for what he thought false
or mean in others, these were his conspicuous
characteristics, and they were combined with a
gentle playfulness and sense of humour, which made
him the most delightful and loveable of companions.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF DARWIN'S WORKS</h3>


<p>In two essays 'On the Coming of Age of the Origin
of Species<a name="FNanchor_134_135" id="FNanchor_134_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_135" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>,' and 'On the Reception of the Origin of
Species<a name="FNanchor_135_136" id="FNanchor_135_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_136" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>,' published in 1880 and 1887 respectively,
Huxley has discussed the course of events following
the publication of Darwin's great work, he having
the advantage of being one of the chief actors in
those events. There is a striking parallelism between
the manner that the <i>Principles of Geology</i> had been
received thirty years earlier, and the way that the
<i>Origin of Species</i> was met, both by Darwin's scientific
contemporaries and the reading public.</p>

<p>At the outset, as we have already intimated,
Lyell and Darwin were equally fortunate, in that
each found a critic, in one of the chief organs of
public opinion, who was at the same time both competent
and sympathetic. The story of the lucky
accident by which this came about in Darwin's case
has been told by Huxley himself<a name="FNanchor_136_137" id="FNanchor_136_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_137" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The <i>Origin</i> was sent to Mr Lucas, one of the staff of the
<i>Times</i> writers at that time, in what was I suppose the ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
course of business. Mr Lucas, though an excellent journalist, ... was
as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe, and
bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to deal with such
a book. Whereupon, he was recommended to ask me to get him
out of the difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, explaining,
however, that it would be necessary for him formally to adopt
anything I might be disposed to write, by prefacing it with two
or three paragraphs of his own.'</p>

<p>'I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus
offered of giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous
readers of the <i>Times</i>, to make any difficulty about conditions;
and being then very full of the subject, I wrote the article faster,
I think, than I ever wrote anything in my life, and sent it to
Mr Lucas who duly prefixed his opening sentences<a name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Many journalists, however, were less conscientious
than Mr Lucas, and most of the other early notices of
the book were pretty equally divided between undiscriminating
praise of it as a novelty and foolish
reprobations of its 'wickedness.'</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Darwin followed the strong
advice given to him by Lyell, and did not attempt to
reply to the adverse criticisms; for the only effect of
these was to arouse curiosity and thus to increase the
circulation of the book.</p>

<p>Although Darwin had wisely avoided the danger
of exciting prejudice against his work by definitely
applying the theory of Natural Selection to the case
of man&mdash;simply remarking, in order to avoid the
charge of concealing his views, that 'light would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
thrown on the origin of man and his history'&mdash;yet
friends and foes alike at once drew what was the
necessary corollary from the theory. It is as amusing,
as it is surprising at the present day, to recall
the storm of prejudice which was excited. At the
British Association Meeting at Oxford in 1860, after
an American professor had indignantly asked the
question, 'Are we a fortuitous concourse of atoms?'
as a comment on Darwin's views, Dr Samuel Wilberforce,
the Bishop of Oxford, ended a clever but
flippant attack on the <i>Origin</i> by enquiring of Huxley,
who was present as Darwin's champion, if it 'was
through his grandfather or his grandmother that he
claimed his descent from a monkey?'</p>

<p>Huxley made the famous and well-deserved retort:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I asserted&mdash;and I repeat&mdash;that a man has no reason to be
ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an
ancestor whom I should feel ashamed in recalling, it would rather
be a <i>man</i>&mdash;a man of restless and versatile intellect&mdash;who not
content with success in his own sphere of activity, plunges into
scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, only
to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention
of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions
and skilled appeals to religious prejudice<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>The violent attack on Darwin's views by the
once-famous Bishop of Oxford was outdone, a few
years later, by an even more absurd outburst on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
part of Benjamin Disraeli, who&mdash;after stigmatising
Darwinism as the question 'Is man an ape or an
angel?'&mdash;declared magniloquently to the episcopal
chairman, 'My Lord, I am on the side of the angels!'</p>

<p>But in spite of attacks like these and numerous
bitter pasquinades and comic cartoons&mdash;perhaps to
some extent in consequence of them&mdash;Darwin's views
became widely known and eagerly discussed, so that
the circulation of the <i>Origin of Species</i> went up by
leaps and bounds. Nevertheless, as Huxley said,
'years had to pass away before misrepresentation,
ridicule and denunciation, ceased to be the most
notable constituents of the multitudinous criticisms
of his work which poured from the press.'</p>

<p>Among his contemporary men of science Darwin
could at first count few converts. Hooker, whose
candid and valuable criticisms of his friend's work
had been continued up to the very end during its
composition, did an eminent service to the cause
of Evolution by publishing, almost simultaneously
with the <i>Origin of Species</i>, his splendid memoir on
<i>The Flora of Australia, its Origin, Affinities, and
Distribution</i>, in which similar views were, not obscurely,
indicated. Of Lyell, Darwin's other friend
and counsellor, Huxley justly says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Lyell, up to that time a pillar of the antitransmutationists
(who regarded him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have
looked at Dian, after the Endymion affair), declared himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a Darwinian, though not without putting in a serious <i>caveat</i>.
Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength and his courageous stand
for truth as against consistency, did him infinite honour<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Huxley himself accepted the theory of Natural
Selection&mdash;but not without some important reservations&mdash;these,
however, did not prevent him from
becoming its most ardent and successful champion.
Darwin used to acknowledge Huxley's great service
to him in undertaking the defence of the theory&mdash;a
defence which his own hatred of controversy and
the state of his health made him unwilling to undertake&mdash;by
laughingly calling him 'my general agent!'
while Huxley himself in replying to the critics,
declared that he was 'Darwin's bulldog.'</p>

<p>Although, at first, Darwin was able to enumerate
less than a dozen naturalists who were prepared to
accept his views, while influential leaders of thought
in science&mdash;like Richard Owen in this country and
Louis Agassiz in America&mdash;were bitterly opposed to
them, the theory gradually obtained supporters especially
among the younger cultivators of botany,
zoology and geology.</p>

<p>It is evident that Darwin for some time regarded
his 'abstract,' as he called the <i>Origin of Species</i>, as
only a temporary expedient&mdash;one to be superseded
by the publication of the much more extended work,
designed and commenced long before. Although the
<i>Origin</i> was only published late in November 1859,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and he was called upon immediately to prepare a
second edition, we find that on January 1st, 1860,
Darwin began to arrange his materials for dealing with
the first great division of his subject, 'the variation
of animals and plants under domestication.' So
numerous and important were his notes and records
of experiments, however, that he soon found that to
expand the whole of the 'abstract,' on the same scale,
would be an impossible task for any one man, however
able and diligent. Unwilling that the results of
some of his special researches should be lost, he
wisely determined to issue them as separate books.
The first of these to appear was that on the <i>Fertilisation
of Orchids</i>, a beautiful illustration of the
relation of insects to flowers in producing crossing.
He had been more than twenty years working and
experimenting on this subject, his interest in it having
been quickened by having read an almost forgotten
book of the botanist Sprengel. Almost at the same
time, and in following years, he wrote papers for the
Linnean Society on dimorphic and trimorphic forms
of flowers, and their bearing on the question of cross-fertilisation.
These papers were the foundation of
his well-known work, <i>The Different Forms of Flowers
on Plants of the same Species</i>. In the same way,
a paper read in 1864 to the Linnean Society was
subsequently expanded into <i>The Movements and
Habits of Climbing Plants</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to delays caused by the preparation and
publication of these books and frequent interruptions
from sickness, the work on variation did not appear
till 1868. It was a very extensive piece of work in
two volumes, and, at its end, Darwin tentatively
propounded a hypothesis to account for the facts
of Heredity and Variation to which he gave the
name of 'pangenesis.'</p>

<p>Charles Darwin had reached the age of fifty, when
he wrote the <i>Origin of Species</i>. At a very early
period in his career, he had resolved that he would
never start a new theory or revise an old one after
he was sixty; as he used laughingly to say, 'I have
seen too many of my friends make fools of themselves
by doing that.' But as he approached this 'fatal age,'
one more subject of a theoretical and highly controversial
nature remained to be dealt with, namely,
the question of the application of the theory of
natural selection to man, both as regards his physical
structure and his intellectual and moral characteristics.</p>

<p>Darwin tells us that in 1837 or '38, as soon as he
had become 'convinced that species were mutable
productions,' he 'could not avoid the belief that man
must come under the same law<a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.' From that time,
he began collecting facts bearing on the question.
As each of his children was born, he examined closely
the signs of dawning intelligence, and made notes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the manner in which new sensations and passions were
exhibited by them. His dog and other animals, for
whom he always showed the greatest fondness, were
closely watched with the object of noting correspondences
between their mental and moral processes and
their modes of exhibiting them and our own; while
visits were made by him to the Zoological Gardens
with the same object. By reading and correspondence
also, an enormous mass of notes was collected, and on
February 4th, 1868, having seen his great work on
Variation under Domestication published, Darwin
was able to make the entry in his diary, 'Began
work on Man.'</p>

<p>As was usual with most of his works, Darwin
underestimated the time required to complete it.
Through all the years 1867&mdash;'68, '69 and '70 we find
the entries in his diary 'working at <i>Descent of Man</i>,'
and only early in the year 1871 was the book finished.
His original plan of compressing his notes on the
expression of the Emotions into a chapter at the end
of the book proved to be impracticable, and the
material was reserved for a new work. This work,
<i>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i>,
was commenced directly the <i>Descent of Man</i> was out
of hand, a rough copy was finished by April 27th,
1871, but the last proofs were not corrected till August
23rd, 1873.</p>

<p>In dealing with the question of the origin of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
human race, Darwin was led to propound his views
concerning Sexual selection, the results of the preferences
shown by males and females, respectively,
not only among mankind, but in various other animals.
It was with respect to some of the conclusions contained
in this work that Wallace found himself unable
to follow Darwin. Wallace maintained that while
man's body could have been developed by Natural
Selection, his intellectual and moral nature must
have had a different origin. He also declined to
adopt the theory of sexual selection, so far as it
depends on preferences exhibited by females for
beauty in the males. Wallace, however, in some
respects has always been disposed to attach more
importance to Natural Selection, as the greatest, if
not the only factor in evolution, than Darwin himself.</p>

<p>It will be seen that although Darwin had in all
probability thought out all his important theoretical
conclusions before 1869, when he reached the 'fatal
age,' yet, owing to various delays, the books, in
which he embodied his views, had not all appeared
till more than four years later.</p>

<p>Lyell, who was a convinced evolutionist before the
publication of the <i>Principles of Geology</i>, as is shown
by his letters,&mdash;and the fact is strongly insisted on
both by Huxley and Haeckel<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>,&mdash;was slow in coming
into <i>complete</i> agreement with Darwin concerning the
theory of Natural Selection. While he followed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
friend's investigations with the deepest interest, his
less sanguine nature led him often to despair of the
possibility of solving 'the mystery of mysteries.' As
Darwin wrote only a year before his own death, Lyell
'would advance all <i>possible</i> objections to my suggestions,
and <i>even after these were exhausted</i> would
long <i>remain dubious</i><a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.' It is evident from the correspondence
that Darwin was at times tempted to
become impatient with the friend, for whose advocacy
of his views he so deeply longed. Fourteen years
after the publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, however,
Lyell, in his <i>Antiquity of Man</i>, gave in his
adhesion to Darwin's theory but, even then, not in
the unqualified manner that the latter desired. Yet
I have reason to know that some years before his
death, Lyell was able to assure his friend of his
<i>complete</i> agreement, and Darwin, six years after the
loss of his friend, wrote, 'His candour was highly
remarkable. He exhibited this by becoming a convert
to the Descent theory, though he had gained
much fame by opposing Lamarck's views, <i>and this
after he had grown old</i>.' Darwin adds that Lyell,
referring to the '<i>fatal</i> age' of sixty, said 'he hoped
that now he might be allowed to live<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>!'</p>

<p>When I first came into personal relations with
Darwin, after the death of Lyell in 1875, he was in
the habit of deprecating any idea of his writing on
theoretical questions. He used to talk of 'playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
with plants and such things,' and undoubtedly derived
the greatest pleasure from his ingenious experimental
researches. The result of this 'play' in which Darwin
took such delight is seen in his books on the <i>Power
of Movement in Plants</i> and <i>Insectivorous Plants</i>;
full of the records of ingenious experiments and
patient observation.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to Darwin that his friend
Wallace was able in 1871 to undertake the preparation
of a work on <i>The Geographical Distribution of
Animals</i>, for, on many points, the views held by
Wallace on this subject were more in accordance
with Darwin's own, than were those of Lyell and
Hooker. Nevertheless, on all questions connected
with the geographical distribution of plants, and the
causes by which they were brought about, Darwin
always expressed the fullest confidence in Hooker's
judgment, and the greatest satisfaction with his
results.</p>

<p>With regard to another great division of his work,
that dealing with the imperfection, but yet great
value, of the geological record, Darwin was always
anxious, when I met him, to learn of any new discoveries.
But he felt that he had done all that was
possible in his outline of the subject in the <i>Origin</i>,
and that he must leave to palaeontologists all over
the world the filling in of these outlines. So great
was the delight with which he used to hear of new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
discoveries in palaeontology, that I often recall our
conversations in these later days, when so many interesting
forms of extinct animal and vegetable life&mdash;veritable
'missing links'&mdash;are being discovered in all
parts of the globe, and wish that he could have known
of them. They are indeed 'Facts for Darwin.'</p>

<p>Very happy indeed was Charles Darwin in the last
years of his useful life, in returning to his oldest 'love'&mdash;geology.
In studying the action of earthworms he
found a geological study in which his rare powers of
ingenious experimentation could be employed with
profit. His earliest published memoir had dealt with
the question, and for more than forty years with
dogged perseverance, he had laboured at it from time
to time. It was delightful to watch his pleasure as
he examined what was going on in the flower-pots
full of mould in his study, and when his book was
published and favourably received, he rejoiced in
it as 'the child of his old age<a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.'</p>

<p>Charles Darwin's death took place rather more
than twenty-two years after the publication of the
<i>Origin of Species</i>. Before he passed away, he had
the satisfaction of knowing that the doctrine of evolution
had come to be&mdash;mainly through his own great
efforts&mdash;the accepted creed of all naturalists and that
even for the world at large it had lost its imaginary
terrors. As Huxley wrote a few days after our sad
loss, 'None have fought better, and none have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
more fortunate, than Charles Darwin. He found a
great truth trodden underfoot, reviled by bigots, and
ridiculed by all the world; he lived long enough to
see it, chiefly by his own efforts, irrefragably established
in science, inseparably incorporated with the
common thoughts of men, and only hated and feared
by those who would revile, but dare not. What shall
a man desire more than this<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>?'</p>

<p>More than a quarter of a century has passed since
these words were written. How during that period
the influence of Darwin's writings on human thought
has grown, in an accelerated ratio, will be seen by
anyone who will turn the pages of the memorial
volume&mdash;<i>Darwin and Modern Science</i>&mdash;published
fifty years after the <i>Origin of Species</i>. Therein, not
only zoologists, botanists and geologists, but physicists,
chemists, anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists,
philologists, historians&mdash;and even politicians and theologians&mdash;are
found testifying to the important part
which Darwin's great work has played, in revolutionising
ideas and moulding thought in connexion with
all branches of knowledge and speculation.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE PLACE OF LYELL AND DARWIN IN HISTORY</h3>


<p>From the account given in the foregoing pages,
it will be seen that&mdash;without detracting from the
merits of their predecessors or the value of the
labours of their contemporaries&mdash;we must ascribe
the work of establishing on a firm foundation of
observation and reasoning the doctrine of evolution&mdash;both
in the inorganic and the organic world&mdash;to
the investigations and writings of Lyell and Darwin.</p>

<p>Lyell had to oppose the geologists of his day, who
led by Buckland in this country and by Cuvier
on the continent, were almost, without exception,
hopelessly wedded to the doctrines of 'Catastrophism,'
and bitterly antagonistic to all ideas savouring of continuity
or evolution. And, in the same way, Darwin,
at the outset, found himself face to face with a
similarly hostile attitude, on the part of biologists,
with respect to the mode of appearance of new
species of plants and animals.</p>

<p>While Darwin doubtless derived his inspiration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and much valuable aid, from the <i>Principles of
Geology</i>, and its gifted author, yet Lyell, with all his
clearness of vision, logical faculty and literary skill,
did not possess the strong faith and resolute courage&mdash;to
say nothing of that wonderful tenacity of
purpose and power of research which were such
striking characteristics of Darwin&mdash;which would have
enabled him to do for the organic what he did for
the inorganic world. If it be true, as Darwin used
to suggest, that the <i>Origin of Species</i> might never
have been written had not Lyell first produced the
<i>Principles of Geology</i>, I believe it is no less certain
that the crowning of Lyell's great edifice, by the
full application of his principles to the world of living
beings, could only have been accomplished by a man
possessing, in unique combination, the powers of
observation, experiment, reasoning and criticism,
joined to unswerving determination, which distinguished
Darwin.</p>

<p>Starting from Lyell's most advanced post, Darwin
boldly advanced into regions in which his friend was
unable to lead, and indeed long hesitated to follow.
Together, for nearly forty years, the two men&mdash;influencing
one another 'as iron sharpeneth iron'&mdash;thought
and communed and worked, aided at all
times by the wide knowledge and judicious criticism
of the sagacious Hooker; and together the fame of
these men will go down to posterity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a tendency, when a great man has passed
from our midst, to estimate his merits and labours
with undiscriminating, and often perhaps exaggerated,
admiration; and this excessive praise is too often
followed by a reaction, as the result of which the
idol of one generation becomes almost commonplace
to the next. A still further period is required before
the proper position of mental perspective is reached
by us, and a just judgment can be formed of the
man's real place in history. The reputations of both
Lyell and Darwin have, I think, passed through both
these two earlier phases of thought, and we may have
arrived at the third stage.</p>

<p>There was one respect in which both Lyell and
Darwin failed to satisfy many both of their contemporaries
and successors. Lyell, like Hutton,
always deprecated attempts to go back to a 'beginning,'
while Darwin, who strongly supported Lyell in his
geological views, was equally averse to speculations
concerning the 'origin of life on the globe.' Scrope<a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>,
and also Huxley<a name="FNanchor_147_148" id="FNanchor_147_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_148" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in his earlier days, held the
opinion that it was legitimate to assume or imagine a
beginning, from which, with ever diminishing energy,
the existing 'comparatively quiet conditions,' thought
to characterise the present order of the world, would
be reached. Both Lyell and Darwin insisted that
geology is a historical science, and must be treated
as such quite distinct from Cosmogony. And in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
end, Huxley accepted the same view<a name="FNanchor_148_149" id="FNanchor_148_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_149" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. 'Geology,' he
asserted, 'is as much a historical science as archaeology.'</p>

<p>The sober historian has always had to contend
against the traditional belief that 'there were giants
on the earth in those days!' The love of the
marvellous has always led to the ascription of past
events to the work of demigods who were not of like
powers and passions with ourselves. Hence the
invention of those 'catastrophies'&mdash;in which the
reputations of deities as well as of men and women
have often suffered. It is the same tendency in the
human mind which makes it so difficult to conceive
of all the changes in the earth's surface-features and
its inhabitants being due to similar operations to
those still going on around us.</p>

<p>Lyell's views have constantly been misrepresented
by the belief being ascribed to him that 'the forces
operating on the globe have never acted with greater
intensity than at the present day.' But his real
position in this matter was a frankly 'agnostic' one.
'Bring me evidence,' he would have said, 'that
changes have taken place on the globe, which cannot
be accounted for by agencies still at work <i>when
operating through sufficiently long periods of time</i>,
and I will abandon my position.' But such evidence
was not forthcoming in his day, and I do not think
has ever been discovered since. Professor Sollas has
very justly said, 'Geology has no need to return to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
catastrophism of its youth; in becoming evolutional it
does not cease to remain essentially uniformitarian<a name="FNanchor_149_150" id="FNanchor_149_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_150" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.'</p>

<p>Alfred Russel Wallace, who has always been as
stout a defender of the views of Lyell as he has of
those of Darwin, has given me his permission to quote
from a letter he wrote me in 1888. After referring
to what he regards as the weak and mistaken attacks
on Lyell's teachings, 'which have of late years been
so general among geologists,' he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I have always been surprised when men have advanced the
view that volcanic action <i>must</i> have been greater when the earth
was hotter, and entirely ignore the numerous indications that
both subterranean and meteorological forces, even in Palaeozoic
times, were of the same order of magnitude as they are now&mdash;and
this I have always believed is what Lyell's teaching implies.'</p></div>

<p>I believe that Mr Wallace's expression, adopted
from the mathematicians, 'the same order of magnitude,'
would have met with Lyell's complete acquiescence.
He was not so unwise as to suppose
that, in the limited periods of human history, we
must necessarily have had experience&mdash;even at
Krakatoa or 'Skaptar Jokull'&mdash;of nature's greatest
possible convulsions, but he fought tenaciously
against any admission of 'cataclysms' that would
belong to a totally different category to those of the
present day.</p>

<p>Apart from theological objections, the most formidable
obstacle to the reception of evolutionary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
ideas had always been the prejudice against the admission
of vast duration of past geological time. It was
unfortunate that, even when rational historical criticism
had to a great extent neutralised the effect of
Archbishop Usher's chronology, the mathematicians
and physicists, assuming certain sources of heat in
the earth and sun could have been the only possible
ones, tried to set a limit to the time at the disposal
of the geologist and biologist. Happily the discovery
of radio-activity and the new sources of heat opened
up by that discovery, have removed those objections,
which were like a nightmare to both Geology and
Biology.</p>

<p>Lyell used to relate the story of a man, who, from
a condition of dire poverty, suddenly became the
possessor of vast wealth, and when remonstrated
with by friends on the inadequacy of a subscription
he had offered, the poor fellow exclaimed sadly, 'Ah!
you don't know how hard it is to get the chill of
poverty out of one's bones.'</p>

<p>Geologists and biologists alike have long been the
victims of this 'chill of poverty,' with respect to past
time. So long as physicists insisted that one hundred
millions, or forty millions, or even ten millions of
years, must be the limit of geological time, it was not
possible to avoid the conclusion stated by Lord
Salisbury in 1894, 'Of course, if the mathematicians
are right the biologists cannot have what they de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>mand<a name="FNanchor_150_151" id="FNanchor_150_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_151" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.'
But now geologists and biologists may
alike feel that the liberty with respect to <i>space</i>,
which is granted ungrudgingly to the astronomer, is
no longer withheld from them in regard to <i>time</i>. We
can say with old Lamarck:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'For Nature, Time is nothing. It is never a difficulty, she
always has it at her disposal; and it is for her the means by which
she has accomplished the greatest as well as the least results.
For all the evolution of the earth and of living beings, Nature
needs but three elements&mdash;Space, Time and Matter<a name="FNanchor_151_152" id="FNanchor_151_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_152" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.'</p></div>

<p>Darwin, equally with Lyell, has suffered from a
reaction following on extravagant and uninformed
praise of his work. The fields in which he laboured
single-handed, have yielded to hundreds of workers
in many lands an abundant harvest. New doctrines
and improved methods of enquiry have arisen&mdash;Mutationism,
Mendelism, Weismannism, Neo-Lamarckism,
Biometrics, Eugenics and what not&mdash;are
being diligently exploited. But all of these vigorous
growths have their real roots in Darwinism. If we
study Darwin's correspondence, and the successive
essays in which he embodied his views at different
periods, we shall find, variation by mutation (or <i>per
saltum</i>), the influence of environment, the question of
the inheritance of acquired characters and similar
problems were constantly present to Darwin's ever
open mind, his views upon them changing from time
to time, as fresh facts were gathered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>No one could sympathise more fully than would
Darwin, were he still with us, in these various departures.
He was compelled, from want of evidence,
to regard variations as spontaneous, but would have
heartily welcomed every attempt to discover the laws
which govern them; and equally would he have
delighted in researches directed to the investigation
of the determining factors, controlling conditions and
limits of inheritance. The man who so carefully
counted and weighed his seeds in botanical experiments,
could not but rejoice in the refined mathematical
methods now being applied to biological problems.</p>

<p>Let us not 'in looking at the trees, lose sight of
the wood.' Underlying all the problems, some of
them very hotly discussed at the present day, there
is the great central principle of Natural Selection&mdash;which
if not the sole factor in evolution, is undoubtedly
a very important and potent one. It is
only necessary to compare the present position of
the Natural History sciences with that which existed
immediately before the publication of the <i>Origin of
Species</i>, to realise the greatness of Darwin's achievement.</p>

<p>The fame of both Lyell and Darwin will endure,
and their names will remain as closely linked as were
the two men in their lives, the two devoted friends,
whose remains found a meet resting-place, almost
side by side, in the Abbey of Westminster. Very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
touching indeed was it to witness the marks of
affection between these two great men; an affection
which remained undiminished to the end. Lyell was
twelve years senior to Darwin, and died seven years
before his friend. During the last year of Lyell's
life, I spent the summer with him at his home in
Forfarshire. How well do I recollect the keenness
with which&mdash;in spite of a near-sightedness that had
increased with age almost to blindness&mdash;he still
devoted himself to geological work. The 264 note-books,
all carefully indexed, were in constant use,
and visits were made to all the haunts of his youth,
with the frequent pathetic appeal to me, 'You must
lend me your eyes.' In spite of age and weakness,
he would insist on clambering up the steepest hills
to show me where he had found glacial markings,
and would eagerly listen to my report on them. But
the <i>great</i> delight of those days was the arrival of
a letter from Darwin! Lyell was the recipient of
many honours, and he declined many more, when he
feared that they might interfere with the work to
which he had devoted his life, but the distinction he
prized most of all was that conferred on him by his
life-long friend, who used to address him as 'My dear
old Master,' and subscribe himself 'Your affectionate
pupil.'</p>

<p>During the seven years that elapsed after the
death of Lyell, I saw Darwin from time to time, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
he loved to hear 'what was doing' in his 'favourite
science.' On board the <i>Beagle</i>, before he had met
the man whose life and work were to be so closely
linked with his own, he was in the habit of specially
treasuring up any 'facts that would interest Mr Lyell';
in middle life he declared that 'when seeing a thing
never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through
his eyes<a name="FNanchor_152_153" id="FNanchor_152_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_153" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>'; and never, I think, did we meet after
the friend was gone, without the oft repeated query,
'What would Lyell have said to that?'</p>

<p>These reminiscences of the past, in which I have
ventured to indulge, may not inappropriately conclude
with a reference to the last interview I was privileged
to have with him, who was 'the noblest Roman of
them all!' On the occasion of his last visit to
London, in December, 1881, Charles Darwin wrote
asking me to take lunch with him at his daughter's
house, and to have 'a little talk' on geology. Greatly
was I surprised at the vigour which he showed on
that afternoon, for, contrary to his usual practice, he
did not interrupt the conversation to retire and rest
for a time, though I suggested the desirability of his
doing so, and offered to stay. His brightness and
animation, which were perhaps a little forced, struck
me as so unusual that I laughingly suggested that he
was 'renewing his youth.' Then a slight shade passed
over his countenance&mdash;but only for a moment&mdash;as he
told me that he had 'received his warning.' The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
attack, to which his son has alluded, as being the
prelude to the end<a name="FNanchor_153_154" id="FNanchor_153_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_154" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, had occurred during this visit
to town; and he intimated to me that he knew his
heart was seriously affected. Never shall I forget
how, seeing my concern, he insisted on accompanying
me to the door, and how, with the ever kindly smile
on his countenance, he held my hand in a prolonged
grasp, that I sadly felt might perhaps be the last.
And so it proved.</p>

<p>And now all the world is united in the conviction
which Darwin so modestly expressed concerning his
own career, 'I believe that I have acted rightly in
steadily following and devoting myself to science!'</p>

<p>For has not that <i>devotion</i> resulted in a complete
reform of the Natural-History Sciences! The doctrine
of the 'immutability of species'&mdash;like that of 'Catastrophism'
in the inorganic world&mdash;has been eliminated
from the Biological sciences by Darwin, through his
<i>steadily following</i> the clues found by him during his
South American travels; and continuity is now as
much the accepted creed of botanists and zoologists
as it is of geologists. As a result of the labours of
Darwin, new lines of thought have been opened out,
fresh fields of investigation discovered, and the
infinite variety among living things has acquired
a grander aspect and a special significance. Very
justly, then, has Darwin been universally acclaimed
as 'the Newton of Natural History.'</p>
